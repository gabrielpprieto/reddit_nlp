9,StickInMyCraw,"\&gt;  Hold on... What I said originally was that US consumption is held up by cheap foreign labor. You told me it wasn't labor, but it was actually capital.

No, I said that the trend of manufacturing is towards capital and away from labor. Production is a function of a mix between capital and labor, and the ratio between those two in manufacturing is steadily favoring capital. To run a farm in the stone age, you needed a bunch of people and some sticks; nowadays you need a couple people and some large machines. The amount of capital per worker in the production process has greatly increased.

It's also important to note that most US consumption is from US sources (ie not ""held up by cheap foreign labor"") - Americans go to American hospitals, get their taxes done by American accountants, watch American movies and buy insurance underwritten by American businesses. You're talking about manufacturing specifically, but that's far from where most Americans' budgets are going.

\&gt;  Literally the statement you're making is that we are, right now in 2019, already at the point where labor is less important to production than automated processes.

It's not like the machines could produce a car without the workers, it's that what takes only one worker to make today took dozens a hundred years ago. The productivity gains of capital are reducing the labor requirements of manufacturing to the point that in some industries it is cheaper to produce widgets in America with a few workers and a bunch of sophisticated machinery than a bunch of Chinese workers with less machinery and high shipping costs.

\&gt;  You're getting all bogged down in details about automation, but this is a fucking absurdist thing to say from my perspective, and I'm not continuing this line of thought until you either retract this nonsensical shit or find me a source to prove it.

Let's step out of the weeds then. High level: GDP has increased at a faster rate than population growth for centuries. The productivity of the average person went up. The cause of that productivity growth was capital accumulation. One person and a bunch of laundry machines can compose a whole laundromat in today's world. If you took away the laundry machines, that one person could not just step in and hand wash the same volume of clothes. That's not ""absurdist,"" that's just a banal truth of economic history.

If 1 person can buy a tool that enables them to do 5 times the work, they can either spend 1/5 of their time working and get the same result as before or work the same amount and get 5 times the result as before. Historically, manufacturing took the second route and we produced more and more physical goods. Eventually, advanced economies started taking the first route and we spent less time producing physical goods and more time providing services and creating intellectual property type goods. I'm saying that that is the type of economy that the rest of the world is converging into.",1,vegan,2019-10-17 19:57:57

79,jazzoveggo,"Strongly disagree:

1. The label ""vegan"" is useful to describe yourself quickly, which is useful in lots of situations.
2. I think to hold ""vegan"" to only an ethical definition is problematic because I think there are lots of different vegan ethics systems.  Utilitarian (a la Peter Singer), rights-based (Tom Regan), feminist (Carol Adams), abolitionist (Gary Francione), environmental/environmental justice (can't think of a particular name off the top of my head), etc.  Plus there are all the little questions that get asked here all the time.  Is it okay to eat honey?  Is it okay to use animal products you already have after going vegan, or buy secondhand animal products?  Is it okay to eat meat out of the trash?  Is it okay to support animal testing?  Is eating brainless shellfish (in theory) not that big of a deal, even if you don't do it personally?  Is it okay to eat eggs from rescued backyard hens?  Should we support reduction/improvements to animal welfare, or only accept the total abolition of animal use?  You'll get different answers from different vegans for different reasons.  So if veganism is about ethics only, WHICH ethics?  And can it be more than one system--if so, which ones?  All of them?  Only some of them?  And why?
3. If we do allow for multiple ethical definitions of veganism... why is it so different to extend the same allowance to people who behave in vegan ways for non-ethics-based reasons?
4. If we say veganism is strictly about ethics, whether it's one, some, or all ethical systems... who even cares about policing that boundary though.  If people are doing a good thing, who cares if they do it for reasons I don't value?
5. I think it's really off-putting to people to strictly define veganism as an ethical thing.  As a vegan, I certainly find it off-putting, and I even moreso felt that way when I was newly vegan/considering becoming vegan.  And I doubt being off-putting helps the cause.

Joaquin wearing the ALF shirt might not be the most productive thing to do, but I will give him allowances considering he narrated Earthlings and was witness to the true torture of what humans have done to animals, especially when it comes to scientific experimentation like vivisection, for example.

If someone wears a USA flag or Uk flag, does that mean they support the awful acts those countries have done through history? I'd say no, but both countries have a history of slavery and war.

**Your Fallacy:**

&gt;predator in the animal kingdom eats other animal **(ie: Animals eat animals)**



**Response:**

Non-human animals do many things we find unethical; they steal, rape, eat their children and engage in other activities that do not and should not provide a logical foundation for our behavior. This means it is illogical to claim that we should eat the same diet certain non-human animals do. So it is probably not useful to consider the behavior of stoats, alligators and other predators when making decisions about our own behavior.
The argument for modeling human behavior on non-human behavior is unclear to begin with, but if we're going to make it, why shouldn't we choose to follow the example of the hippopotamus, ox or giraffe rather than the shark, cheetah or bear? Why not compare ourselves to crows and eat raw carrion by the side of the road? Why not compare ourselves to dung beetles and eat little balls of dried feces? Because it turns out humans really are a special case in the animal kingdom, that's why. So are vultures, goats, elephants and crickets. Each is an individual species with individual needs and capacities for choice. Of course, humans are capable of higher reasoning, but this should only make us more sensitive to the morality of our behavior toward non-human animals. And while we are capable of killing and eating them, it isn't necessary for our survival. We aren't lions, and we know that we cannot justify taking the life of a sentient being for no better reason than our personal dietary preferences)

You're being far too generous. He wasn't someone who didn't have the means to understand and explore veganism. He was a privileged, educated person who rejected it and vehemently attacked our mission for his own agenda and his own desires. As for many of us thinking like him, even if that is true none of us had the platform he did that we used to demonize veganism to the extent that he did. 

Aside from that, he had a not insignificant hand in that whole faux-woke, ""look Ma, I'm respectin' the whole animal!"" nonsense that reinforced in the average Joe the idea that they could humanely and honorably consume animals. He was a purveyor of decadence and a true enemy of the animals. I mean, he passionately defended foie gras for fuck's sake.

For the general masses, I thought it was an amazing episode. I really did not expect South Park to be making social commentary about both veganism and climate change. That's a massive audience that will be seeing these messages.

In this episode, Cartman had a heart attack because of his dietary choices. They demonstrated that a vegan diet isn't limited to ""only salads"" (yes, that's not news to a lot of us, but there are tons that still hold the perception that a life without meat would translate to a life of salads only or something similar). They showed that Cartman, a self proclaimed meat lover, was not only happy, but couldn't tell the difference between fake meat and real meat.

Almost everyone in the episode was also a proponent of transitioning towards plant based diets. That was presented as the popular opinion. That is such a GIANT flip on the narrative that is typically shoved down our throats in media where vegans are depicted as demasculated or crazy etc.

This episode was really packed with a lot of great content. It was an awesome surprise.

I also thought it was brilliant how they diverted the expectations. When Randy took that first bite of the Impossible Whopper and proclaimed it tasted like shit, I was met with immediate disappointment. I didn't think it was atypical of South Park to make such a move, though. That narrative was later diverted though! They went from presenting fake meat as ""it tastes like shit"", which baited those who want to hear that to presenting it as the best burger they all had.",3,vegan,2019-10-17 18:52:47

Another thing you can do in the mean time is use some cooking techniques to hide certain textures or flavors, so that you can at least get some of the nutrition of these foods without having to using them in large amounts or in plain perpetuations.

‘Hello, 

It has been brought to my attention that someone is using patreon to fund animal abuse. Here is a link to the creators page: https://www.patreon.com/hampture?

Their content centers on videos of hamsters placed in abusively small enclosures, which are then placed under water in fish tanks. This is clear animal endangerment and abuse, and I believe it should not be tolerated on patreon. 

The fact they think it’s okay that their hamsters are stuck inside these incredibly small and dangerous enclosures for many months shows what kind of person they are. They’re using the uniqueness of an ‘underwater enclosure’ for money at the expense of the animals safety and well-being. I have seen this creator be frequently called out on twitter over this as well. They have been advised to build a bigger enclosure, not have the hamsters underwater, etc. but they have continued to ignore it all. 

Please reconsider allowing them to fund this animal abuse on patreon.’ 

I just looked at their twitter (which is why i mentioned it in my email) and they have a load of tweets from people telling them to stop, etc. It doesn’t seem that they view their hamsters as animal companions, just as way to make money.

Black salt has an eggy taste which may or may not fit, depending on how many eggs you used before.  Use it if you want to add a slightly egg flavor to the mix, but not for any of the oyster part.  

Cooked Chinese eggplant or cooked, de-seeded Italian eggplant are another way to create oyster texture, although they're so soft they're better as whole oyster replacements rather than for minced (where they might lose a little too much of their texture), and oyster mushrooms is probably better here.  

There are other unusual ingredients you can use to create vegan [seafood flavor](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/chabuu/looking_for_nonfried_homemade_vegan/eur2u86/), but they're more geared towards fish, and if you find a good vegan oyster sauce, it will be closer in flavor to oysters than any of them, and you may want to add them sparingly if at all.

So here are the lines of interest here (assuming you aren't just using this whole thing to rope me into further trolling)

Me:

You:

... obviously implying that you don't believe this to be true anymore...continued:

&gt;The present and future of manufacturing is more and more dependent on capital than labor. Your argument is based on a view of the world economy frozen in the 20th century rather than the one we're sitting in.

Literally the statement you're making is that we are, right now in 2019, already at the point where labor is less important to production than automated processes. You're getting all bogged down in details about automation, but this is a fucking absurdist thing to say from my perspective, and I'm not continuing this line of thought until you either retract this nonsensical shit or find me a source to prove it.

292,StickInMyCraw,"\&gt;  Labor has nothing to do with production?

Well that's not really what I said, but I think you're aware of that so let's just pretend you're arguing in good faith. I said manufacturing is relying more and more on capital relative to labor. This is plainly true: A factory 100 years ago might feature dozens or hundreds of workers doing simple tasks like sorting or painting parts or screwing in one specific screw over and over. Nowadays those tasks are automated. A factory today has way fewer actual people inside it but is still far more productive, and that's because of all the machines (capital) that have replaced various tasks.

A key point of evidence: manufacturing output in the United States has increased over time while the number of people employed by manufacturers has gone down. This isn't surprising - when a society accumulates more and more capital, that capital enables higher and higher productivity. You think a human being is individually sealing every jar of pickles in 2019? Think about how many more accountants we'd have if accounting software didn't exist. I mean a ""computer"" used to refer to a literal person whose job it was to compute. Now, a machine does that.

You can literally just look at the financial statements of American manufacturers and see that the amount spent on equipment and machinery goes up over time while the number of employees dwindles. Look at a farm in the US and you'll find fields that would have once taken hundreds of people to individually plant each seed that are now dealt with by one farmer and her family operating a bunch of big farm implements. It's not like farmers are just putting in the number of hours equivalent to the hundreds of people it would've taken historically.

This isn't a controversial fact at all and I'm amazed you think this is satire. I mean the definition of capital is ""the means of production.""",1,vegan,2019-10-17 17:47:44

that the stress-induced elevation of core tem-

conceivable that housing in small or in-
appropriate cages induces chronic stress with
increased core temperature.""

""Baseline core temperature decreased with
increasing cage size while the febrile
response increased with cage size. There

389,whatsnextman,"Bourdain was a privileged jet-setter who made millions flying around the world to enjoy immense luxuries few get to experience, then turned around and wagged his finger at those who raised their noses at the food of the impoverished of the world. He never lived his life as someone who was poor, struggling, and desperate for *anything* to eat but boy he sure did love building his brand off of identifying with them and using them to justify his luxuries.

My family was very poor when I was growing up and I ate desperation, survival meals, the kind of which he paraded about with some smug, delusional sense of reverence for those who don't get to *choose* to eat that way part time and return to the comforts of the developed world when the camera stops rolling. His overall message of enjoy life and be grateful for what you have is fine but wholly negated by his own greed and wanton consumption and that of those who he influenced.

As for the, ""Don't talk bad about him, he's dead,"" crowd I agree, but only to the extent that he's not around to hear it. Everyone else who worshiped him and bought into his ideas needs to know how wrong and exploitative he was, with his positions on animals and people.

On the topic of suicide, he gets no sympathy from me. I was struggling with then-undiagnosed bipolar disorder, alienated from friends and family because of my illness, and contemplating suicide when I'd read his comments about how vegans should kill themselves if they couldn't enjoy a piece of stinky cheese. Veganism has been one of the only rock-solid things in my chaotic life, so that hit me particularly hard.

Am I happy that he struggled and killed himself? Not at all. I lost a great buddy earlier this year, the only other person who ever truly understood me, when he killed himself. It sucks, it's awful, and I don't wish that on anyone else but we never turned our negativity outward. 

Joking about suicide had long been one of my coping mechanisms, something to neuter an ever-looming threat to my life but I've never, ever suggested that someone else should kill themselves. I wouldn't dream of it, joke or not. Mr. Bourdain not only *didn't* have that consideration for anyone else, he used a ""joke"" (if it was even that, who knows) about suicide to build his brand.

472,StickInMyCraw,"\&gt;  Fine... but how long does it take and how many emissions are produced on the way there? If we don't reduce our usage NOW, we're fucked. 

That's where carbon pricing comes in. To accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. And the political pressure behind carbon pricing has already boiled over and many jurisdictions have some form of it already. This once-in-a-millennium economic reorientation you're advocating would take time too, and I'd say a lot longer given how much larger the constituencies against it are.

Also, to be clear, in the EU/US, emissions are dropping and have been for years. We are literally ""reducing our usage NOW"" and at an accelerating rate.

\&gt;  Those countries are only able to do what they do because they rely on cheap labor around the world to provide everything else. 

Maybe at one point this was true, but we are now in a world where automation is eliminating more manufacturing jobs in advanced economies than outsourcing, and this only increases as wages/labor costs rise around the world. In some industries manufacturing is moving back to advanced economies because the cost of automated production closer to their consumers is cheaper than outsourced wages and shipping, and carbon pricing will promote this because shipping uses so much energy. The present and future of manufacturing is more and more dependent on capital than labor. Your argument is based on a view of the world economy frozen in the 20th century rather than the one we're sitting in.",1,vegan,2019-10-17 16:20:43

**Your Fallacy:**

&gt;we are animals **(ie: Animals eat animals)**



**Response:**

Non-human animals do many things we find unethical; they steal, rape, eat their children and engage in other activities that do not and should not provide a logical foundation for our behavior. This means it is illogical to claim that we should eat the same diet certain non-human animals do. So it is probably not useful to consider the behavior of stoats, alligators and other predators when making decisions about our own behavior.
The argument for modeling human behavior on non-human behavior is unclear to begin with, but if we're going to make it, why shouldn't we choose to follow the example of the hippopotamus, ox or giraffe rather than the shark, cheetah or bear? Why not compare ourselves to crows and eat raw carrion by the side of the road? Why not compare ourselves to dung beetles and eat little balls of dried feces? Because it turns out humans really are a special case in the animal kingdom, that's why. So are vultures, goats, elephants and crickets. Each is an individual species with individual needs and capacities for choice. Of course, humans are capable of higher reasoning, but this should only make us more sensitive to the morality of our behavior toward non-human animals. And while we are capable of killing and eating them, it isn't necessary for our survival. We aren't lions, and we know that we cannot justify taking the life of a sentient being for no better reason than our personal dietary preferences)

(Please forget the fact that israel is doing every single one of the things i accused them of tho)'

Ok, now please show me where I made that assertion.

&gt;You can say whatever you want sweetheart, but don't be surprised when you end up looking like a fucking idiot. Cute that you think I give a shit about you, aww &lt;3

The fact you keep replying does in fact indicate you do. And sorry but you're not my type.

&gt;Gary does know jack shit about whats going on in Israel. And you'd know if you'd been here yourself, or read up on the thousands of human rights violations, chants for death to all Palestenians done by Israeli citizens, and unjustified murders of Palestenians, as well as foreign tourists who support Palestine.

So now Gary DOES know jack shit? Ok. I'm assume you're going to want to edit that. Maybe the Israelis want death to Palestine because they keep trying to bomb them and have to knock the missiles out of the sky? It's just one theory.

&gt;I'm sure you can make an argument for how John Rose has done more for veganism than you or I ever will. Doesn't mean I can't call him out on being a Nazi fuck, just like I can call out Gary for being a racist fuck if I'd like.

You can do whatever you want, clearly.

&gt;Yeah, but isn't it kinda funny how you, the absolute dipshit who's never been to Israel and self admitted to knowing absolutely nothing about the country, feels comfortable slinging antisemitic allegations at someone marrying an Israeli, and who has lived here for years? But sure baby, keep twisting this as much as you'd like if it helps you sleep better at night.

So ad hommy today, aren't you. And again with the flirtatious pet names. Does your future wife know you're hitting on me? Antisemitic? Isn't going *against* Israel considered antisemitic? It sounds like you are......yep....just double checked the definition. Assuming i was pro-Israel, which I never claimed to be, you would be the antisemite in this conversation, regardless of your impending marriage, which sounds like it will be short lived with your seething hatred of her homeland, but who knows. 

&gt;But this is fun, keep going Ms. BIG BRAIN.

I'm a dude but whatevs. Guess I'll still wait for actual facts to be presented on your position that Israel is the aggressor. Guess I shouldn't hold my breath.

A few friends and I have reported the Patreon page, emailed Patreon directly, and made attempts to contact them on Twitter. We can't allow this page that subsists on abuse and endangerment to stay up.

In short of what they are doing, they are taking hamsters with a abusively small enclosure and sticking them underwater in a poorly ventilated death trap. They are soon planning on chucking these poor animals inside a lake as well. They stream on twitch and have a youtube channel i will leave links to those at the bottom

How to report

Log in to Patreon (must be logged in to report), find the page (https://www.patreon.com/hampture) and select report for harmful activity. None of the specific report options exactly apply, but any report should alert their support team.

Email- The message: One of the creators on Patreon (can be found at https://www.patreon.com/hampture) has used your website to build a platform to fund animal abuse. The creator in question's content centers on videos of hamsters placed in abusively small enclosures, then those enclosures are placed inside fish tanks full of water. This is clear animal endangerment and animal abuse, and should not be allowed on Patreon.

Then, I started reading posts in my local vegan group about activism and ethics, and realized I was only eating a plant-based diet, and had a lot of learning to do. It took me a while to make the leap from plant-based diet to ethical vegan, and to fully understand the commitment I was making. There's a bit of a learning curve, don't you think?

I do correct people who say ""I'm going vegan for a week"", because you can't be a part-time vegan. You either are or you aren't.

That doesn't mean that everything a vegan says or does is okay, we should debate and criticize each other if we think that some action or campaign is problematic but we should not verbally support animal abusers when they try to shut down a critic who just states a fact.

&gt; I have noticed a decrease in the amount of flak I get from people when I tell them I eat a plant-based diet rather than a vegan diet.

Of course, because you tell them that what they are doing is okay. A sexist would probably like you more if you tell him that you don't beat your wife because you think that that's healthier for your hand than if you tell him that you don't do it because it's wrong.",1,vegan,2019-10-17 14:49:28

I rescued her one and a half years ago from slaughter. She spent the same time with me, living her absolute best life as she spent in the farm, before an illness caught up with her. It's a common disease in factory farmed chicken, especially those abused for eggs. 
She may have been rescued from slaughter, but she was never free from the consequences of factory farming and died because of it in the end. 
Go vegan for animals like her. Personalities that just want to enjoy life and have so much to give, that deserve the world but are treated as numbers destined to live and die cruelly.

831,Brilliant_Hovercraft,"&gt;  She claimed that veganism caused her to become orthorexic and obsessed with ensuring she'd meet her dietary needs. 

Some people use a special diet to hide eating disorders, so it's probably not that a plant based diet increases your risk of eating disorders, but that someone with an eating disorder is more likely to say that they follow a plant based diet.

&gt; She claimed that the diet is too difficult to follow for most people because they don't have a background in nutrition, which I found to be a bit condescending.

If you look at statistics about how many people are overweight and/or have some deficiency in first world countries you see that that's a problem in general even with an omni diet.

Furthermore there are many studies that show that vegetarians and vegans are healthier and live longer, so it seems that they do fine in general.

&gt; She says that plant-based diets are unsustainable for most people because it's expensive and they'd have to supplement too many things. 

In some special situations a plant based diet might be really more expensive but usually if someone says that they either are eating only fast food and convenience food or they simply have no idea what they are talking about. If you cook yourself with staples like rice and lentils and buy vegetables frozen or canned or fresh in the right season a plant based diet is much cheaper.

In first world countries you can get the supplements you need in most drugstores or on the internet very cheap and if you are in doubt whether you get everything you need you can get a blood test.

&gt; she said that it's unfortunate but we are omnivores and need to eat animal products. 

Many health organizations say that a plant based diet is healthier and you can find many studies and statements which show this, so that claim is simply wrong.",1,vegan,2019-10-17 13:12:17

With your limitations I would look into doing 1 meal a day vegan first, to see how it goes :) I never had PCOS but vegan whole food really helped me with period pains.

 A list of foods to  take from that are low carb and vegan :

* **Vegetables:** Many vegetables are low in carbs. This includes [tomatoes](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/tomatoes/), [onions](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/onions/), cauliflower, eggplant, bell peppers, [broccoli](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/broccoli/) and Brussels sprouts.
* **Berries:** Berries like [strawberries](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/strawberries/) and blueberries can be eaten on a low-carb diet. 
* **Fatty fruits:** [Avocados](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-proven-benefits-of-avocado/) and olives are incredibly healthy. They are low in carbs but high in fat.
* **Nuts and seeds:** Nuts and seeds are low in carbs, but high in protein and fat. This includes almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, [peanuts](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/peanuts/) and pumpkin seeds. - Nut butters are amazing and you can dilute them (especially cashew) in water to make ""cream"".
* **Soy:** Foods like tofu and tempeh are high in protein and fat, but low in carbs. This makes them acceptable on a low-carb vegetarian/vegan diet.
* **Legumes:** Some legumes, including green beans, green peas, edamame...
* **Healthy fats:** [Extra virgin olive oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/extra-virgin-olive-oil/), avocado oil and [coconut oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coconut-oil/).
* **Chia seeds:** Most of the carbs in [chia seeds](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-health-benefits-of-chia-seeds/) are fiber, so almost all of the usable calories in them come from protein and fat. - Flaxseeds are also very healthy.
* **Dark chocolate:** If you choose [dark chocolate](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-health-benefits-dark-chocolate/) with a high (70-85%+) cocoa content, then it will be low in carbs but high in fat.

You could work out meals centered around legumes and fat sources like avocados and nuts (this would be your main calories) and veggies.",1,vegan,2019-10-17 13:04:01

Also, it is my understanding that ALF is not very centrally organized. This makes it hard to control what is done in their name. Some ALF people might be strongly opposed to things done by other ALF people, but can’t really control what they do. You start to get a “no true Christian” argument going at this point, where anyone who does something you don’t like must not be a “real” member of the group.       
      
In any case, I’m not really trying to debate the merits of ALF. I’m trying to bring some perspective on how this kind of organization is viewed by the general public, and how that can impact the perception of veganism if the two become linked in the public eye.

Yes it fucking is! Those countries are only able to do what they do because they rely on cheap labor around the world to provide everything else.

Male calves get sledge hammered minutes after birth.

Male chicks get ground up alive.

Female hens bodies are so used up because of the genetic modifications that they too are killed years before the end of their Natural life span

908,hadmatteratwork,"&gt;In a sufficiently competitive market, a worker is paid the full value of their labor.

This is blatantly untrue. If a worker was paid the full value of their labor, it wouldn't be worth it for the company to hire them. A company will only hire you if you generate more value than they pay you. I feel like if you had thought about that statement for even 30 seconds you would see how obviously false it is. Adam Smith literally states as much in the first book of Wealth of Nations. Either way, none of that shit has anything to do with the matter at hand.

&gt;So stop with this socialist nonsense, because it doesn't actually solve the problem. At least, not without plunging us into extreme poverty.

lol ""extreme poverty"" is what we're heading towards because of Capitalism and the need it has to convince people to consume, consume, consume. We could many times over provide a reasonable well being for everyone without destroying the planet. Under a planned economy, we could do things like install clean energy everywhere and do carbon recapture. We could do things like reforestation. We could do things like make products that are designed to last as long as possible instead of falling apart after a couple years or less. We could expand public transit massively and phase out cars. Capitalism is incapable of incentivizing any of that.

The sea level rise is already locked in by the way, we won't avoid that.

giving up meat sounds super logical in my head. I just don’t understand how he can continue eat it with knowedge that he took someone’s life.

I wouldn't go that far because people are free to make their own decisions and you could argue that I save a few animals because she eats way more vegan stuff with me than she would with someone else. Are you with the right person if you disagree on such an important issue? That's a bigger question.

I've heard statements like this before, but I think that often they're sensationalized and do more harm than good by making people distrust the whole scientific community.

[This](https://cei.org/blog/wrong-again-50-years-failed-eco-pocalyptic-predictions) is a compilation of scientists making predictions over the last 50 years that have been radically wrong. In the 70s, they said that there was an imminent ice age coming. In the naughts, they said that all of the ice in the Arctic would be gone by the 2010s. Neither of these came true, and they're especially bizarre claims because they're polar opposites of each other.

I don't know what the solution here is. I think that the damage we're doing to the environment is very real, and I hope I don't come off like I'm attacking you, but I have trouble believing such fatalistic statements.

\- pasta with a tomato sauce and some veggies (zucchini, eggplant, red bell peppers are all great options)

\- pizza ! Buy a pizza dough (most are vegan, they should be), tomato sauce on top, some sliced mushrooms and onions, and cubed smoked tofu or vegan cheese

\- a veggie curry ! Chop vegetables and cook them in a pot with a little oil first then some water and cover it. Add (vegan) curry paste (green or red) and coconut milk. Serve with rice or another cereal :D

1053,JillianDark,"Personally, I don't know any pescetarians that cut out red meat and poultry because of environmental concerns. I think many people think it is more ethical to eat fish instead of mammals or birds. Just like the person you talked to, apparently. The fewer similarities an animal shows to us, the less people will relate to it generally. While most people I know would acknowledge that pigs and cows have personalities and are sentient individuals (even though they will still eat them...), I think the same is not true for fish in their eyes. So I think many simply think it is the lesser evil to kill a fish when compared to killing a warm blooded animal and especially a mammal. They may perhaps worry about the dolphins and seals that die as by-catch, but not the fish themselves. 

Apart from that, I think some pescetarians cut out meat solely because of health concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, I totally agree with what you said about the fishing industry. It is utterly horrific what it does to the animals and the environment. And just because a fish doesn't resemble us or doesn't communicate in a way that we can (easily) understand in no way means it doesn't feel pain and has the capacity to suffer.",1,vegan,2019-10-17 10:05:43

On a personal and emotional level then yes, this can be a factor.

She is not being personally lied to on this, it is publicly available, peer reviewed research by climate scientists as a whole. 

About the politicians thing that you say, well I’m not really sure what your point has to do with Greta then.

You are getting me wrong. I understand there is climate crisis and i understand how important it is and i do not deny all the science behind it. Heck, i'm even vegan because of that. But this is totally different.

What will happen is instead of tackling this crisis down the effecient way, politicians will use media, in this case Greta, to milk on the crisis. I guarantee there will be a tax in some form that is related to climate in the near future, wheather addinial food taxing, fuel taxing or a direct tax per capita for... breathing or existing. This is how politics work, they have no interest to solve any problem. Scientists do, but they have no media attention.

Scientists do not set taxes. Nor are they running some sort of profitable business. The idea of climate scientists choosing that particular career to get rich is laughable. 

&gt; Greta is amazing but her mental condition is very unique. People who have this condition can hardly separate what is true and what is not. Her parents are awful to let people in the media use her and put disgusting thoughts into her mind on which they base her reality. She was given to read a sentence saying ""you have stolen my childhood"" and now her condition makes her actually believe it, which is depressing.

No, Asperger’s is not unique to Greta, it affects nearly 40 million people at any one time. This is part of the wider autism disorder spectrum, which has been studied and documented for decades. Asperger’s does not lead to those who have it being unable to distinguish between truth or not. Some might even say the opposite in high functioning cases like Greta’s when it comes to factual/scientific matters. Therein lies the heart of the matter too - it doesn’t matter what you say about Greta’s character or condition, all she is doing is underlining the science on climate change and the need for change. That’s it. She’s not going off the rails with some wacko ideas. If you don’t trust Greta because you find it hard to stomach things from a young girl or someone who has Asperger’s, then just defer to the science, it’s all there.",1,vegan,2019-10-17 09:06:51

Most non animal derived fabrics or materials like pleather are just... not great, or hard to find. I recently purchased a pair of chelsea style rain boots that were rubber because it was the only other material I could find them in other than leather. EVERYTHING is made from leather it feels like. Most people would argue that rubber is much worse environmentally than leather, too.

Taped? Looks like he used a secure method of a stronger material in the video. Some sort of metal wiring. Like you'd see in a cage.

Yeah, and cats need meat in their diets yet some vegans try to make em vegan. Your statements are nothing but conjecture and ignorance at someone attempting to acheive something unique, yet you claim it's animal abuse when none is present.

And no, cows don’t die when you milk them. You can eat cheese without an animal dying for it, as long as your steer clear of ones made with rennet. 
I’m all for fighting mass agriculture and cruel practices in these industries- but let’s be real here. A farmer that’s raising chickens and cows for themselves and maybe friends/family they can pass excess of these products to is not slaughtering chickens for eggs or slaughtering cows for milk or cheese. It’s a bit of stretch to say animals are dying for it.
Meat- on the other hand- we can maybe agree on. An animal definitely dies for it. 
If you want to convince people of your cause, maybe try not being so extreme in your accusations. 

FYI I do about 80% plant based diet. The biggest turn off from going completely vegan is the entitled and self righteous attitudes other vegans have about it.

1598,Genghis__Kant,"The parent comment was:

&gt;Dr Greger has a great video on this. The corps just want to make money. If they make sausage, then they have all the machines to make sausage and the distribution channels to sell sausage. If consumer demand changes to want plant based sausage, they will gladly make it as all they care about is making money. They will give up the pigs easily. Think about all the issues dealing with just the manure. They will gladly switch, all we need is the demand. This is a bottom up problem, not a top down problem.

I disagree.

Pig farmers, slaughterhouses, butchers, etc. will not ""gladly"" give up pig farming because of local vegans or issues regarding manure.

They will absolutely keep producing and trying to sell because you really can't easily convert a dairy farm to a plant-based milk operation. You can't easily make a slaughterhouse into a plant-based meat factory.

Basically, the parent comment is an oversimplified notion of how corporations and consumers function.

&gt;Supply and demand exist in harmony. One does not last without the other.

That is also a gross oversimplification. 

Surpluses can continue to happen due to the absurd profits and such involved. 

Ex: butter mountain, government cheese, milk lake

And marketing is an example of how companies manipulate demand. Unfortunately, consumers aren't some perfectly logical beings that aren't influenced by powerful corporations whatsoever. 


Basically, these companies are not going to ""gladly"" give up what has been immensely profitable for decades.

They will absolutely put up a fight. 

Hell, they already are. Have you heard of the Green Scare? Or the non-vegan industries' use of gag orders? Or their legal battles with vegan companies?

But I get the sense that, for whatever reason, the current culture is dead set on tearing anyone down when they disagree with them on anything, and this seems especially prevalent in vegan circles, so I have my doubts about the legitimacy of what that group is saying. I also agree with people who are saying that, if someone doesn't like AV, they should just walk away and do their own form of activism. As I see it, the benefit of taking on the AV name is simply that you have an easier time connecting with other activists.

But, maybe she was really trying and on the trajectory towards vegetarian.  And, from that point of view, I should support and encourage her, not be angry at her.  Plus, people self-identifying, regardless of their actual behavior, still increases our numbers... so it's not necessarily all bad.

He presented himself in a manner that shows he was strong, and fierce. He showed to the majority of the US that he was a leader. Something all of presidents, but a few had to do. Something that is a key factor in winning a debate, is showing you are a leader. This leader trait you try to show you have, it strengthens your point.",1,vegan,2019-10-17 01:29:32

They know its real they described how humans are a cause of it. 

&gt;One amazing example is humans! Wow! Can you believe it something that is taught all around as something that is serious, and can cause animals to die out and suffer is real!

This supports their point, humans overpopulate and reduce the territory of animals which then are overpopulated. Your lack reading comprehension is so severe that you are making their argument for them while being condescending. You are the one that looks like an idiot here, not them.

&gt;And no, overpopulation can happen in places that humans haven’t even fucked with. It’s an actual problem that occurs, even if humans don’t take their “territory.”

Nobody said overpopulation never happens without humans and it isn't relevant to the current conversation about animals that are ""overpopulated"" because of humans.

2. Absolutely.  And it wouldn't, most of our farmland goes toward growing crops for animal feed.  We have more than enough food to feed humanity, even going into the future.
3. Not difficult.  Just eat a variety of vegetables, grains, and beans/nuts/seeds (and a B12 supplement!), but it's nothing crazy or anything.  I'm talking, like, eating a black beans one day, and then switching it up with chickpeas, and then some mock meats, then tofu, then have a PB&amp;J... Etc.  Just like how you don't eat the same thing everyday on an omni diet.  (Also if you were wondering you don't need to combine proteins with every meal.  That's a myth.)
4. Back when I tracked all my nutrients, I found I had no trouble meeting my needs even when I wasn't trying to be particularly healthy.  So I don't worry about it too much.  I just try to make sure I fit in my vegetables, beans, and grains on a regular basis, take a B12 supplement everyday, and I also take a multivitamin as a failsafe.
5. Gross. :P In all seriousness, I think it's better than eating conventional meat, but it's still unnecessary.  Why would I choose to end a (potentially, which is why I don't think it's as bad) sentient life when it's only optional, not mandatory?",1,vegan,2019-10-17 00:34:37

I was a vegetarian teen and went vegan once I was out of the house, too.

I've also had to take breaks from this sub sometimes because of all the holier than thou attitudes/bashing on people who weren't vegan, or vegan for the ""right"" reasons--even after going vegan myself!

1/3c flour  
1 1/2 cup veg broth  
1 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk  
1/4c nutritional yeast  
salt, pepper, nutmeg to taste 

Create a roux by melting butter in a large saucepan or deep frying pan, mixing in flour until fully incorporated, then adding broth and almond milk about a quarter cup at a time, over medium/low heat. Stir in nutritional yeast, S+P, nutmeg. This makes a lovely cheesy bechamel. 

Mushroom Sauce: I like to finely dice mushrooms and add that to the butter before the flour, and use mushroom broth instead of veggie broth. Great with garlic and onions too.

Nutritional yeast is also a great topping or seasoning for veggies, rice, popcorn, avocado toast.... the possibilities are endless. It's got kind of a nutty, cheesy taste.",1,vegan,2019-10-17 00:12:20

1913,Re_Re_Think,"&gt; Did you choose to become vegan because of health issues or environmental issues? Both?

I went vegan for animal rights, but there are many different ways people first become interested in veganism.  Some people do it to save money, some want to improve their health, some do it simply to try something new.  

&gt; Do you believe the world is better off with everyone being vegan? If so, how would you respond to the issue that more farmland might need to be created?

The opposite is true: the world would be better off if everyone was vegan because it is more efficient to grow crops and use them directly than it is to grow crops and feed them to animals every day of their lives until the day they are killed for food.  A cow or a pig uses a lot more calories of plant material for feed than it creates, because animals are fundamentally an inefficient way to produce food.  If everyone went vegan, it would produce so much food that it would massively help human starvation and malnutrition, which has been well established already.  We currently are feeding and keeping alive about 70 billion land animals in animal agriculture using plants, while about 9 million people, who could be fed with the farmland that creates some of those plants directly, starve to death each year.  That doesn't make any sense; if you want to prevent human suffering, veganism indirectly helps lessen it by freeing up more farmland for use and creating calories of food more efficiently.  

&gt; How difficult is it to get complete proteins? Do you have to eat an extreme variety of foods for them?

It is not difficult to get protein.  Protein is an essential nutrient, but it is also enormously overemphasized for many historical reasons which don't apply any more or were never true in the first place.  Vegans without any special planning get over the amount of protein they need on average.  You don't have to eat an extreme variety of foods to get protein; eating reasonable amounts of almost any grain and bean will provide plenty of protein.  If you want to read more, there's a bit at [the bottom](http://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/d3piv2/what_would_the_socioeconomic_effects_be_if_everybody_went_vegan/f04izq7?context=3) of the linked comment.  

&gt; How do you combat not getting nutrients that aren't present in plant-based products?

Plants are incredibly nutrient packed foods.  Everyone remembers hearing about how healthy fruits and vegetables are, until someone goes vegan!  There are certain nutrients of concern, like any other diet, like for example Vitamin B12 (Vitamin B12 is technically not made by either plants or animals, it is made by specific microorganisms which exist in or around animals, which is how it ends up in them. Vitamin B12 supplements are made with microorganisms grown outside of the animals, in a vegan way), but there are vegan sources for all of them (otherwise plant-based diets wouldn't be possible, and they are).  

If you're interested in it, you can begin learning about vegan nutrition [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ajsbp7/help/eeyyzyi/?context=3). 

&gt;  How do you feel about bug ranching, or eating bugs? If you disagree, why?

When I started eating it, I realized that the sauce had cheese in it.

In hindsight, she probably didn't fully understand what I was asking, because it seemed like she only knew a few words of English, in which case, there should have been someone else there who could answer those questions, because what if I was allergic to cheese and she told me there was none in the sauce?

2044,JimmyLuckyChance," I say I'm mostly vegan. Here is why (copy/paste from an answer to a different post a couple of weeks ago):

Update on that post: I have been vegan for about 2 weeks (since the answer)... but I know I am a cheese sandwich or a muffin away from not being vegan. 

Start copy/paste:

[I know what I am going to write is hypocrite]

I usually tell friends I am vegan at home, vegetarian outside of the home.

The reason for this is because I can obviously buy everything I need in my country (I am from and live in Lisbon, Portugal) to be vegan, but outside of the home, when food is prepared by others, it is not so easy.

Example:

Despite existing numerous restaurants with vegetarian/vegan options, and there existing a few vegan restaurants, most are not or have not vegan options (99,9+%?). With vegetarian options there are a few.

So if I went to any of the 3 cafes near me now and wanted to have something to eat, I could have bread with bread and coffee.

Some cafes do now have vegan options, but most often I go for vegetarian (cheese sandwich, cup cakes, the like).

If I am outside of Lisbon then it becomes more difficult, I could have rice with salad for 5 days straight, but usually I compromise. What I have learned is that most restaurants have prepped their meals before hand, and sometimes they don't have a lot of options without meat or fish (even rice with beans they add bacon to it, more often than not). So I might ask to stir fry some vegetables, and cook some pasta. 50% of the time this works.
The other 50% I either have vegan side dishes if these are available, or compromise with an plain egg omolette or something like that.

Lately (past few months) I have tried more and more to choose vegan options. For instance asking if they have jam to put on the bread and things like these.

But I find that in my food choices it is very inconvenient to be vegan outside of the home all the time.

The term inconvenient was added on purpose: is my inconvenience worth the life of an animal? No it is not, and I need to address this, and strive to be vegan all the time...",1,vegan,2019-10-16 22:42:35

K, so if you don’t make seitan already then absolutely you need to start. It’s not complicated, just takes a bit of time- best part is you can make a huge batch and freeze extra portions. The [seitan recipes here](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/?s=Seitan+) are fantastic. 


Are other beans ok? Like black beans, kidney beans, white beans...? If so then you can make that dal recipe swapping in whatever bean does work. 


This [kale and quinoa one pot meal](https://food52.com/recipes/2434-one-pot-kale-and-quinoa-pilaf) is a favorite, i swap in olives instead of the cheese, use olive oil instead of walnut oil and i usually swap in sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds instead of the pine nuts to save money- and i use twice as much of them. Any sturdy greens work, and leftovers are fantastic so i often double the recipe to have it cold for lunches. 


Another thought is that you can adapt the [no meat athlete veggie burger formula ](https://www.nomeatathlete.com/veggie-burger-recipe/) to use whatever bean works - it’s awesome because you can make and cook a bunch of patties and keep extras in the fridge, i have also made it into meatless balls.

So just in case you really wanna know here’s how the economics of the meat industry will go (on a light level not accounting for the tons of other variables accounted for).  We will use me and kroger as the supply and demand.  

So kroger puts meat on the shelf and I don’t buy it. The meat is then marked down and sold to some one else or thrown out.  Next time kroger orders meat they order less so they mark down less meat.  So then the farmer will raise and kill less animals in the next season to account for the fact that I did not consume the meat. 
So no I did not save the animal that I passed up on buying it’s carcass as meat. (That animal is already dead I can’t save him, there is a lag in this system). But I did save more animals from being bred and raised only to be killed. 
So say as an Omnivore I would eat meat every day and eat say a lb.  so that’s 365 lb of meat a year that the industry will calculate they don’t need to produce the next year.",2,vegan,2019-10-16 22:08:25

**Your Fallacy:**

&gt;meat source to get protein **(ie: Vegans cannot get enough protein)**



**Response:**

Humans need for about 6% of their diet to be comprised of protein, though most doctors recommend 9% just to be sure. Many nuts and vegetables contain enough protein to meet this nutritional requirement, so plant-based diets provide adequate protein for human health.
There is no credible science that equates a plant-based diet with protein deficiency. Moreover, we are not facing a kwashiorkor epidemic among vegans or anyone else in developed and developing nations, but we are facing both diseases and chronic health problems associated with the consumption of excess protein. It is also noteworthy that people have been thriving on a plant-based diet throughout history, and more people are choosing to do so every year without suffering from a protein deficiency. Other factors being equal, vegans have been and continue to be at least as healthy as their peers in this regard.)

Agents like egg whites, gelatin, and fish guts are used to clear particles out of wine, like tartrate crystals. Also called “wine diamonds”, they’re a bi-product from having the grape juice soak in the skins of the grape. When exposed to oxygen, they clump and form sparkling crystals (hence the name).  Tartrate crystals are safe to consume, but gritty like sand, so many producers choose to filter them out through mechanical filtration, aging, or through the use of animal products.

Natural wines are not filtered, so they’re generally okay for vegans. They may be cloudy in appearance, or have a noticeable build-up of crystals. This is not considered a flaw. The presence of wine diamonds is a way that a wine maker may show off — like “look at me, I’m so talented that my wine does not need any work from barrel to bottle”.

A lot of producers in the US are moving away from animal products because of the extra hassle from the FDA if you use them (aka fear about salmonella and mad cow disease). A wine maker I studied under actually quit making wine to filter wine full-time. He found he could make more money with better hours just filtering other people’s wine (cruelty free ofc).

Their roses are excellent, including the flagship brand Summer Water. They specialize in the $13 price point but have higher as well, and I must say that a lot of the $13 wines are very good value. If you'd like an invite I have a whopping 26 ""Give a Box"" invites where I can email someone 3 bottles that you choose, you cover shipping/tax. Just DM me your email address. Fair warning, you'll be ""signed up"" to get a monthly mailing. You can do a taste profile and they'll randomly select wines that match that, you can also tweak it to say get 1 white 3 red per month, or however many you choose. If you go 4+ bottles shipping is free . You can easily skip months right from the website with one click (I've done this many times). Fully cancelling does require at least an online chat session. I invited my wife's email address with a Give a Box, and cancelled that account without any issues via online chat.

I don't understand the argument behind the second question here. The over 56 billion land animals we kill every year for food are herbivores who are fed crops, so how could humans going vegan require more cropland? We'd just eat the crops directly instead of having their nutrients processed through an animal carcass middleman.

So yeah, everyone should be vegan because it would use much less land:

&gt; The 7 billion livestock animals in the United States consume five times as much grain as is consumed directly by the entire American population.

&gt; Each year an estimated 41 million tons of plant protein is fed to U.S. livestock to produce an estimated 7 million tons of animal protein for human consumption.

&gt; The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% – an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world. Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife.
&gt;
&gt; The new analysis shows that while meat and dairy provide just 18% of calories and 37% of protein, it uses the vast majority – 83% – of farmland and produces 60% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions.

My point is that if you can produce more food in your local area than required by your local population (maybe using your highlighted polyculture methods without causing unnecessary environmental damage) then transporting surplus to the next nearest location in need is perfectly sensible. 

There will always be areas capable of producing more than they need and areas that aren’t so lucky... people aren’t about to give up living in cities, for example. 

So my view it that as long as people eat local when appropriate, and pay attention to farming practices when importing and don’t consume piles of novelty foods from far away just for the sake of it then some level of food transportation is ok.

2211,TanktopVegan,"&gt; Innate in your point is neurological sophistication. You’re just saying it’s relevant in the context of the ability to experience suffering.

Neurological sophistication is only relevant to the extent that it allows you to suffer. Two individuals experiencing equal amounts of suffering is equally bad. 

&gt;Yeah, I don’t give a fuck about bugs. In this bizarre hypothetical Unnecessarily stabbing a dog with a needle seems worse than say killing some flies.

Weird that you'd call my hypothetical bizarre when it's literally a variation of your own hypothetical. And I'm not sure why stabbing a dog with a needle is worse when arguably it produces much less suffering than killing flies.

&gt;But as you acknowledge you have to consider the actual capacity to experience suffering 

That's obviously a given. You can't even talk about suffering when the capacity to suffer isn't there. 

&gt;and in that you have to prioritise neurological capacity

That doesn't follow. You have to consider neurological capacity for sure. I don't see why you have to prioritize it. If cutting off a limb produces x amount of suffering in a bug and y (&gt;&gt; x) amount of suffering in a dog, then the latter scenario is much worse. But if cutting off a limb produces more suffering in a bug than plucking a hair off a dog, then the former scenario is worse. Neurological capacity is only used to infer the amount of suffering. But once you know the amount of suffering, neurological capacity is irrelevant.

Veganism is, in my opinion, a direction we should all be moving in. It means doing your best to avoid animal products, and critically examining the morality and principles of viewing animals as products for consumption. Speciesism is ingrained in ALL of us from the day we were born, unless our parents and other caretakers were hardcore vegans who made a point to say “this is wrong and here’s why.” Even then, it’s still a huge part of society. Maybe this person you mentioned doesn’t understand the full implications of their choices, or hasn’t had the opportunity to even consider that animals are not commodities. Maybe they’re eating mostly plant-based for health reasons. I’m not saying this is right, but I would much rather someone be “mostly vegan” than eat a standard Western diet heavy in meat and dairy for the sake of overall cruelty and environmental reasons. As a vegan, it would be awesome if you could help them connect the dots, and worry less about the semantics. I highly doubt the person you mentioned wants to imprison and torture animals.

But then there are those actual Vegans who do care for the animals, but for some reason don't care if their significant other cares for the animals, and yeah, I don't understand that in the slightest. I care about the animals too much, I understand people can be ignorant of the truth in the matter so I don't mind being friends with people who are not Vegan but I will call them out on being immoral and many times also being hypocrites, but when you date someone you are meaning to be closer to that person than anyone else. You don't need to necessarily have the same beliefs, but you do need to often times not have conflicting beliefs. A pro choice girl who always aborts isn't going to last with a pro life man, no matter how compatible they are in every other way. And to me Veganism and not vegan is that incompatible as well. 

As a Vegan I'm recognizing mine and others' taste pleasures isn't and shouldn't be considered more valuable than the life and well-being of sentient creatures, and if someone is NOT vegan they are literally claiming the opposite, that their taste pleasure IS more valuable than the life and well-being of sentient creatures, so that's why I absolutely agree, I would not date a non-vegan and I do find it weird that many Vegans would, when you understand what they're claiming as non-vegans.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 21:25:21

2243,dopechez,"&gt;I would say that a boss who pays his worker less than the value the workers labor is worth is stealing

In a sufficiently competitive market, a worker is paid the full value of their labor. If they weren't, they'd find a different employer who would pay them more. Also, I wonder if you also consider it stealing when the worker gets paid even while the business is taking losses? Something tells me you'll engage in special pleading and try to pretend that it's actually ok to do the exact same thing you're complaining about, but in reverse.

&gt;And Capitalism also fails spectacularly while also being completely incapable of ever solving this problem. Carbon taxes are useless for any kind of long term mitigation of climate change.

The reality is that there are currently almost 8 billion humans on this planet, and they all want a high standard of living.

I knew a vegetarian that was working on becoming vegan because they knew it is ethical. Those are the kind of people who will work alongside activist vegans. They are now vegan and have been for at least over a year.

Other vegetarians that are not working towards veganism are generally not on the same page as vegans. In other words, they are continuing to support rape/murder/torture of others and do not intend to stop.

When a ""radical"" vegan or such informs them of said harm that takes place due to egg/dairy industry, a common response is that vegetarianism is doing ""enough"" or it's ""progress"".    To a vegan, that sounds absurd - it's saying that raping and murdering a bit less than what's ""normal"" is ""good enough""/""progress"".

They may be persuaded to be vegan. So, you could say they're ""potential allies"", I guess. You can say that about most other non-vegans, too, though, right?",1,vegan,2019-10-16 21:08:44

2269,StickInMyCraw,"\&gt;  The only metric that matters is global growth.

My point is that economic development inherently decouples itself from energy growth. In the earlier stages of economic development there is an emphasis on physical needs like food and transportation, appliances, etc., but this transitions into an economy based on services and intellectual property. The only reason I'm bringing up advanced-economy growth is to show that economic growth is not inherently linked to energy growth.

\&gt;  you fantasy world where 100% of global growth is software-based 

As I said before numerous times, software is just one part of services, which is what dominates growth in many of the world's largest economies. It is not unrealistic to anticipate a future in which most of the world steadily converges into the economic model of the EU/US, where services and intellectual property make up most of the economy and energy is increasingly generated from renewable sources for the mostly static manufacturing sector.

\&gt;  we will have killed ourselves long before then. It doesn't even merit discussion. 

And how long do you suspect a once-in-a-millennium economic reorientation across \~200 countries will take?

\&gt;  No one is making phones that last a decade because it's a failure of a business model. 

No one is making phones that last a decade because software is advancing at a pace that people will be trashing their old phones regardless of their physical quality. Using an iPhone from 2009 to run today's apps is not workable.

Planned obsolescence happens under very specific conditions, it's not a universal law of all markets. Why do you think your ketchup can last for 2 years? Why does anyone produce canned goods at all? Because in most markets, planned obsolescence is a competitive disadvantage and reduces profits. Which is why if you're looking for it you'll find that tons of everyday products come with warranties now. Some don't, and that's a problem that needs tackling.

Yes! But I think at a slower rate than milk-alternative because of the phrase ""I could never go vegan, I love meat too much!"" the phrase of dairy products only is commonly brought up after they realize they can't use ""I love meat"" as a reason to justify animal usage. 

I think it's absolutely true of a similar trend, but at a slower pace. UNLESS my hopes of Impossible really going at this tackle along side Beyond meat.

Because both companies know Tyson could easily swoop in and grab everything if they don't work together in cornering the alternative meats section.

If we create a new race of humans, we'll call them Blues, and I detest them *just because they're blue*, then that is racism.

If this race of people happened to murder, rape, steal, and torture everyone they came into contact with (or I at least thought that they did), and I detested them for *those* reasons, then I am in no way racist. I have a justified (at least to me) reason for hating them over things they can theoretically change.

The reason why actual racism is wrong, is because you're discriminating against someone over a reason that they literally have no control over. It is stupid to hate someone because they are black *simply because* they are black. They didn't get to choose their skin color (and even if they could, hating someone because of a color is a horrible reason to hate them obviously, but I digress).

Gary gave examples why he is against Palestinians, and it is *clearly* not just because they are Palestinian. They are doing something, (or at least he believes) they are doing horrible acts. Do you really think if Gary was approached by a 5 year old Palestinian kid you had to concept of what was going on or what his people in general were doing, that Gary would hate the kid?

We are aware of concerns that  surfaced a few years ago, specifically with degraded Carrageenan (which  is actually known as poligeenan and not permitted in food anyway) in  animals.

I had started becoming more aware of my health- I was really passionate about making sure the things I was putting on my body were safe and natural and good for me, but then I was still eating Big Macs and Domino's regularly and completely addicted to sugar. So that was a little hypocritical. 

My parents got chickens, and I adore them. It really made it impossible to have any cognitive dissonance in regards to loving animals and eating them. The animal on my plate was the exact same as the ones out in the backyard that I cuddled and adored and would have been beside myself if they were harmed.

I had just taken an interest in the zero waste movement and the animal agriculture industry is a major source of pollution and a strain on the environment. Refusing plastic is great but boycotting such huge, detrimental industries like the meat and dairy industry expands your impact so much more.

2431,r3c0nn3ct,"The site that you sourced is about women during pregnancy. I’m not referring to any specific cases(such as a addiction to caffeine or during pregnancy), but in general. If you deprive yourself of protein you will start wanting foods high in protein. I am surprised you answered ‘no’ to that question since you seem to have done a insane amount of research in veganism specifically(as well as having experience in arguing the vegan point of view)

I appreciate your time and explanation. It’s always interesting to see the other parties point of view. I don’t think I’d ever be able to convert into veganism due to the unclear line about its healthy/unhealthy controversies. I’ll explain;

If I said smoking cigarettes was bad for your health, I shouldn’t really have to site sources or back up that claim with much research. It’s pretty clear and when I started smoking the chest pains were a clear indicator I needed to stop. If you had told me that I was just smoking the wrong brand, I wouldn’t be able to believe that or be convinced of that. If you said to start dipping instead, my own senses would tell me that’s bad for me also. Probably by the feeling of having my gums being cut. There’s no movement saying ‘tobacco is good for your health’. It’s obvious these are bad.

The decision to cut meats out of a diet is far different, since there’s no obvious or clear answer. You are obviously 110% sold in the veganism idea and I’m not judging you for that. As I would hope you would not judge me for deciding to eat both vegetables and meats for dinner tonight. I don’t think less of a person who makes decisions different than me unless it harms me directly.

I realize that opens up the topic to the idea of climate destruction, but there’s plenty of counter arguments about the impacts of farming and such so not to derail.. 

If there was proof that one party here is right, I could very, very easily start eating vegetables only. But there’s flag bearers on both sides here. Plenty of scientists will explain the problems with eating too much soy, the defense mechanisms that plants have, and lack of nutrients you’ll get by going strictly plants. If you’re wanting me to go dig into Google and YouTube  I can but I’m sure you’re already entirely aware of those points I mentioned and already have your opinion made up on them.

At the end of the day, it reminds me of other ongoing wars such as ‘christians VS Athiests’ or ‘Gays VS Straights’ or ‘republicans VS Democrats’. It’s just another massively exaggerated controversial subject that divides mankind even further. 

If someone wants to eat only plants, I wouldn’t dare tell them not to. If they seemed healthy and happy, I would not tell them to start eating meats. But there’s not enough evidence to prove to meat eaters that they should stop eating meats. Simply because there is so much counter proof (again, I can go to Google and YouTube and start throwing links at you, but I’m sure you’re well aware of the scientists that say that meats are valuable to our diet).

I will admit the only thing I dislike about eating meats is the abusive lives that cows and chickens live. For this, I usually take advantage of hunting seasons. That way the deer can live their life in the wild, and be bagged fairly quickly and usually painlessly. 

So yeah the only part of veganism that I can agree with is that processing is inhumane. So I don’t really eat fast food at all.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 20:05:41

What exactly is stopping you? Your selfishness? Your taste buds? Are people forcing titties down your throat? I'm being serious.
I am cold towards vegetarianism because people think that just because they're not eating dead corpses, that their choices don't cause incredible suffering to cows and chickens. Furthermore, if you buy dairy, you are financially supporting rape (of cows), child separation, stealing of the child's food, and murder of the spent dairy cow and her young child. If you buy eggs, you are directly backing an industry that blends male chicks alive or throws them in gas chambers. 

This is why vegetarianism is not a ""transition."" You're just trading one form of animal cruelty for another. Remember that the dairy industry is part of the meat industry.

So exactly why are you not vegan? Do you live in a food desert? Do you have some rare health condition that makes it necessary for you to cause harm to animals? Or do you just love cheese and eggs too much?

If they're just ignorant as I was, I think informing them in a less hostile way is a good approach since they're already headed in the right direction.

I find his critique of the tension between Israelies &amp; Palestines insensitive but it does not seem it is stemming from racism. I think it's possible for someone to not have sympathy for oppressed groups while they're still oppressing animals (and not focus on their race). 
   Albeit I find it immature and not having compassion for people, but that is how being misanthropic feels. Not giving any human a free pass because all are seen with the same hate. Yes, exploited animals go through allot but what about compassion towards people...Gary should of stuck to just discussing animal liberation rather than get political &amp; confuse everyone. 

I'll admit his generalisation of the Israeli-Palestianian conflict makes me suspicious. Could it be he's siding more with isreali because they're more vegan-friendly. 
Then again I don't know much about the situation in that part of the world. All I know is that Palestinians are predominantly Muslim &amp; the isrealies are Jewish. If religion didn't exist maybe this planet would not be as divided. 

Not being on board with an ideology doesn't equate = racist. 
From an atheist perspective, Muslim religion is NOT a religion of peace (thank my ex-Muslim friend who is also vegan for showing me countless appalling things in the Qur'an)  Anyone that doesn't support that religion (as well as all other religions) are pegged as ""islamophobic"" , because they can't critic religion seperate from a person.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 19:05:05

I'm not a professional what so ever, but I'll throw in my two cents. My first thought is that you should make sure you get enough calories. Your body is probably going through enough now without adding a calory deficit on top of that. The food that makes a vegan diet are typically lower in calories and fat than meat and dairy, so just keep an eye on that.

I've found that tofu and chickpeas are really good sources of protein to base meals around. Myself, I'm an adventurous eater, but I have kids who are not. With tofu and chickpeas, it's easy to get some protein into the body even when eating is difficult. If you explore curries based on indian or thai cuisine with coconut milk and veggies and tofu or chickpeas, you will be able to make nutritious, tasty food easy.

&gt;I made a vegan dinner last night with my girlfriend and it came out lovely! Some Mushroom Larb. It was great, I just need to learn to create a vegan substitute for fish sauce (soy sauce helps, but it lacks a certain tang).

You could try hoisin sauce, seaweed, or miso paste to add fishy flavor.

&gt;Help can come in many forms, but right now I need recipes (which I am finding online). I would also love to learn about substitutes for animal fats like butter or beef fat.

African peanut stew is one of my favorites. Usually with kale or other greens, with a garnish of cilantro and fresh peanut. If you like making sushi, there are unlimited combinations that can be made with cucumbers, carrots, squash, tofu... or whatever else you have lying around. Sometimes working within limitations can help spur creativity.

Animal fats can be hard to replicate. You could experiment with oils like coconut, or even Crisco, vegetable shortening, or margarine depending on what you are cooking. Adding a mashed avocado or banana adds a good consistency and can be subsumed by other flavors depending on the dish. There are a few brands of vegan butter out there that are fairly good as well, like Miyoko's. Really it will depend on the dish itself.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 18:46:08

2656,StickInMyCraw,"\&gt;  Ok so your fundamental issue here seems to be that you simply don't understand that climate change is a global issue. Climate doesn't give a shit about the imaginary lines humans have drawn all over the place. The reason the US and Europe are moving away from manufacturing is because we're outsourcing that shit, not because it's just not happening anymore. 

The physical goods of a typical westerner are largely unchanged. There was a time when economic growth in the EU/US meant more microwaves, more TVs, more dishwashers, more tangible production, but nowadays a marker of increased prosperity is something like having a therapist or a financial adviser or better healthcare or more advanced degrees. I'm not saying that Americans no longer buy microwaves, but that is not the growing part of the economy. Were manufacturing all still located in the US, that wouldn't change the fact that the growth areas are not tied to increased energy usage. 

We're talking about growth - yes, China is now building our refrigerators instead of America, but building fridges isn't where advanced-economy growth is. Your whole case was that capitalism was predicated on infinite economic growth and that infinite economic growth meant infinite growth in energy usage.

\&gt; it will always generate way more profit to make phones that last 2 years and break by design than to make phones that will last a decade or two.

Not to the people making phones that last a decade or two. Making products that last longer is a competitive advantage if consumers value that.

You're also predicating this on the idea that production is inherently tied to emissions, when we already have the technology to create power without fossil fuels. If it were made cheaper to power your factory with clean sources of energy than fossil fuels (ie a carbon tax), the cost-sensitive capitalists of the world would switch over.

&gt;I meant stoop down to the method you were using. I keep making you feel like I think I'm better than you or something. I'm just trying to convince you that being a dick isn't the way to convert people to vegan.

Maybe it's time for you to take a step back and re-read the exchange in question. I indeed told them that their opinion was ""tone-deaf bullshit"" and that their regurgitation of carnist propaganda was not a positive contribution to the subreddit. Beyond that, we have had an ongoing, productive, and good-faith discussion. You, on the other hand, are not and were never engaged in discussion with this outsider, instead directing your attention toward me in what I can only assume is a perverted attempt to somehow make veganism more attractive to the world at large. Based on the empiric evidence in this thread, do you believe you have been successful?

I say this because it is only towards your pseudo-empathetic vegan passivity that I directed any sort of vitriol. I view it as more insidious than the simple ignorance of the dominant carnist dogma. I am not trying to convince you to go vegan, though; I am trying to convince you to stay out of the way.

&gt;Are you unfamiliar with the scientific literature on how people actually change their minds? It's pretty well researched stuff. You really should look into it and read some books on it assuming your goal is to change people's minds.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to changing a human mind. I'm happy to read any research you may know of, but understand my skepticism for books whose authors are unable to convince me to buy them.

&gt;I showed you a study from Cornell that used Reddit, the platform we are on. And studied the success of certain language styles in changing people's minds. I felt that it was relevant. What was your main issue with it?

No, you linked an editorialized summary of the contents. The study took place within /r/ChangeMyView, a place where people actively seek the opportunity of being convinced. Who knows how they would react to argument outside of that context, and beyond that how can you reasonably extrapolate any conclusions toward people who do *not* willingly seek out these opportunities?

&gt;Do you have any better methods to offer? If so, what are they and are there any studies that back them up?

First, You have this over glorified ideology of farm life. Let me tell you it sucks. It is costly. Most farmers can't pay their bills these days. So many videos shows a unrealistic few of life on a self sustaining farm.  You will work 10+ hrs every day.  It isn't just a 3 hr a day job. It is smelly, hot and sweaty. It isn't the rose like video you see.

Second, you want to work for a year and then buy land as if that is your end goal. It won't be because how do you pay for it all the stuff after that. Seed cost money, water cost money to get, machinery costs money. This isn't how success works. It takes years of screwing up to get to finally figure out what works. In my first year of growing stuff, I kill 96 plants out of 100. Then I got that number down to 40% and finally I am in the 25% range. You don't see the progression on Facebook or Reddit, just the end result.

I don't follow any crazy diets - fruitarian, 80/10/10, raw til 4, vegan keto etc. are all really restrictive in my opinion and set you up to fail because they put you in the mindset that you have to eat a certain way. Just focus on mostly whole foods so you're not loading your body with junk, and use an app like Cronometer to get an idea of your calorie, macro, and micro nutrient needs. You will probably need to supplement with B12, Vitamin D, Iodine, Iron, and Selenium because those are a little harder to get in a vegan diet. Once you get into a routine that you like that allows you to hit your targets, you really don't need to rely on the app. I used it for the first few weeks to get an idea of what I should be eating, but now I just log a day every couple of months to make sure I'm still on track. In terms of scheduling my meals, it's no different than before I was vegan. Usually breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with some snacks in between.

As far as cost, things might be slightly different in the UK than here in the US, but I find that it is so much cheaper to eat vegan, as long as I'm not relying too much on mock meat/dairy. I can get a pound of dried lentils for $1, where a pound of ground beef would be $5 or more. Mock meats usually cost roughly the same as real meat. I think it's pretty easy to be vegan in the UK. I don't know how close to London you are, but I was there earlier this year and it's vegan heaven. I'm sure it gets more difficult the further from the city you get, but even on a day trip to the Cotswolds I found vegan options at restaurants easily. But yeah, I can't say enough good things about vegan food in London. It knocked my socks off to walk into Waitrose and have multiple vegan prepared foods waiting on the shelves, for like £2. You NEVER see vegan premade sandwiches at the grocery store here in the US, and if you did they'd probably be like $8. And even restaurants that weren't exclusively vegetarian/vegan had multiple options, and menus were clearly labeled. That's not common here, I've only seen it once or twice. And then there's countless vegetarian and vegan restaurants. We didn't have enough time to eat at all the ones I wanted to, and I was there for a week lol.

That LMWH (enoxaparin) is less able to prevent thrombin thrombin production and binds less to plasma proteins and skin cells than Heparin made from animals. But this then allows LMWH to be more predictable and longer lasting than Heparin.

2748,The_Ebb_and_Flow,"&gt;I think a lot of other forms of hatred and intolerance can only exist with the support of speciesism underneath them. 

Research supports this:

&gt;Our research showed that the philosophers were right when they drew an analogy between speciesism and other forms of prejudice. Speciesism correlates positively with racism, sexism, and homophobia, and seems to be underpinned by the same socio-ideological beliefs. Similar to racism and sexism, speciesism appears to be an expression of Social Dominance Orientation: the ideological belief that inequality can be justified and that weaker groups should be dominated by stronger groups ([Dhont, et al., 2016](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.2069/abstract)). In addition, speciesism correlates negatively with both empathy and actively open-minded thinking. Men are more likely to be speciesists than women. Yet, there are no correlations with age or education.  
Speciesism also manifests in real world behavior. In our studies, speciesism predicted whether people are more willing to help humans than animals, or “superior” animals to “inferior” animals. For, example, when given the choice of donating to a charity that helps dogs or pigs, people are more likely to help dogs than pigs the higher they score on speciesism. Similarly, the higher people score on speciesism, the more willing they are to invest time to help homeless people than to help establish basic rights for chimpanzees. Finally, speciesism is related to ethical vegetarianism. Even though our studies showed that not everybody who rejects speciesism believes that eating meat is wrong, we still observed that people higher on speciesism tended to prefer a meat snack over a vegetarian snack.

**Response:**

From an ethical perspective, it is generally agreed that one individual's right to choice ends at the point where exercising that right does harm to another individual. Therefore, while it might be legal and customary to needlessly kill and eat animals, it is not ethical.
Simply because a thing is condoned by law or society does not make it ethical or moral. Looked at differently, it is logically inconsistent to claim that it is wrong to hurt animals like cats and dogs and also to claim that eating animals like pigs and chickens is a matter of choice, since we do not need to eat them in order to survive. So it is clear then, that eating meat is only a matter of choice in the most superficial sense because it is both ethically and morally wrong to do so.)

2777,hadmatteratwork,"&gt;Look at how many US workers are employed producing goods vs services over time...

Ok so your fundamental issue here seems to be that you simply don't understand that climate change is a global issue. Climate doesn't give a shit about the imaginary lines humans have drawn all over the place. The reason the US and Europe are moving away from manufacturing is because we're outsourcing that shit, not because it's just not happening anymore.

Maybe I can use a thought experiment to explain what I'm talking about here.

Imagine we have the technological and manufacturing capabilities to create physical goods that last essentially forever. What would happen under a capitalist system in that case? I'll give you a hint: No Capitalist entity is going to put themselves out of business. Capitalism is doomed to over produce, because it will always generate way more profit to make phones that last 2 years and break by design than to make phones that will last a decade or two. Generating disposable garbage is basically the only thing Capitalism is good at. This is what I'm talking about. Under a system where production is driven by need instead of profit, there's every incentive to make things last longer because it means less work to reproduce society, and, by definition, less emissions. Under Capitalism, it means loss of profit, loss of jobs, and poverty.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 17:54:23

2824,Re_Re_Think,"&gt; t gets interesting when she starts talking about her entire body shutting down and when she started to ‘cheat’ on her vegan diet that she quickly started feeling better.

I did happen to see the beginnings of part; it is completely possible to have a badly planned diet, to start eating other foods (including ones of animal origin), and having these other foods provide appropriate nutrition, but that doesn't mean that the foods she chanced on were the only source of these nutrients.  More on that below. 

&gt; Do you believe the body craves nutrients that it needs?

No, this isn't always the case.  There are different counterexamples of how the body can react in seemingly random or unhelpful ways when an insufficient diet happens, because, while very complex and able to do a lot, our bodies are not perfect or flawless in their ability to interpret the world.   

For example, I might not hear as well as you do (we would have differing abilities to hear sound), and another person might be a super-taster compared to us (they would be able to taste and identify much smaller amounts of something than us).  And none of us can see as precisely as a telescope or a microscope can.  

Instead of this, sometimes our senses can only perceive, and bodies can only react, within a certain limited range of actions.  Even fairy everyday ""cravings"" can be misleading: 

""Mild dehydration is [often masked as feelings of hunger, when really your body just needs fluids](https://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20920951,00.html),"" says Alissa Rumsey, RD, spokesperson for the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. 

(This is why drinking water or other low or zero calorie, hydrating drinks regularly is an important part of weight loss habits: because it can actually help us consume slightly fewer calories from not feeling as hungry.)  

When our ability to sense and react to the world around us is limited to what it is, and there are better technologies that can help us determine more precisely what is the problem, and what the right thing to do is, we should use them (like using a telescope instead of our unaided eyes, or using a blood test or the chemical analysis of foods to determine if we have a dietary problem and which food to add or remove from diet to help fix it).  

Additionally, it's not a good idea to completely depend on our own senses to solve this problem for another reason, which is that: especially when the human body is suffering from a deficiency, parts of it can start functioning more badly or even breaking down, including the parts we might use to identify or make changes to diet even without modern technology (our taste buds, our brains, etc).  So the problem can be even worsened if we ignore it, delay it, or use the wrong ""solutions"" rather than the right ones.  

-------

We don't know exactly what triggers food cravings in many cases, 

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172095/

but we do know that the desired food can have little to do with the nutritional content of it or any deficiency if present.  We see this in pica, which is the desire to eat non-nutritive substances (hair, paper, metal, etc) altogether.  

One well-known example of pica related to a nutritional deficiency is Pagophagia, or the desire to eat ice or cold things, when a person is suffering from anemia (which can be related to iron deficiency) or possibly other mineral deficiencies.  Pagophagia is a misdirected and unhelpful behavior, because our body doesn't instinctively, on it's own, understand or interpret the world completely; we have to study, use education, or purposefully try to learn about the world to try to do that.  Eating ice will not provide iron, and won't fix the underlying deficiency, because the craving is just an emergent reaction of some kind of signalling going on in our body, but our body is not precise enough, on its own, in always understanding what is happening to it, in order to give us the right impulses or directives to fix every problem that can arise.  

&gt; Also, do you believe that all nutrients that the body requires can be found in a strict vegan diet?  

Yes, we know that there are vegan sources for all [essential nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient#Essential_nutrients), and that well-planned plant based diets can provide them.  And we know this because of things like 

* a [long history](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/8nixff/a_healthy_diet_isnt_one_that_requires/dzvxujn/) (see the books listed if you want to read about it) of investigating nutritional deficiencies, 
* modern chemical understanding of what is happening within our digestive system, and to the essential nutrients and metabolism at a molecular level when foods are eaten, 
* epidemiological (that means, population level) data for vegans over long periods of time showing that they do not suffer any significantly greater rates of disease compared with non-vegans (for a few, there may even be lower rates.  Although again, this does not mean all, because not all diseases are ""lifestyle diseases"" which can be treated or often prevented through factors like diet and exercise).    

and evidence like this is why the current scientific consensus from major dietetics organizations is that it [is healthy](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/dieteticorgs) for all stages of life.  

------

You don't have to take my word for it either!  You can see for yourself (or the woman in the video could have checked for herself) by asking a doctor for a blood test aimed at nutrition, or by using a free online nutrition tracker like https://cronometer.com/ for a few days to see what kinds of things you're getting too much of or too little of in diet.  This is an interesting and useful thing to do whether you're vegan or not, because it can tell you a lot about your current diet.  

&gt; If so, where can I go to find a balanced vegan diet that will not put me in this lady’s sort of condition?

If you're interested in how a vegan might start trying to get complete nutrition in their diet, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ajsbp7/help/eeyyzyi/?context=3) are two beginner guides written by Registered Dietitians (most doctors do not specialize in nutrition, but RDs are the medical professionals who do, and it's protected title in the US, which requires specific, college level education in nutrition, so they're often a good source of information).  

Simply using a basic multivitamin, can be one thing that's helpful for a lot of people (vegan or not) in getting better nutrition (if you start eating a lot of vegan meals make sure it contains at least Vitamin B12).  Another way to start creating a foundation to make sure you're eating a varied and well balanced diet is the phone app ""Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen"" which is a [checklist of foods](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/dr-gregers-daily-dozen-checklist-2/) to aim for eating (although it's just a guide and you don't have to get them all perfectly, every single day, to be healthy).",1,vegan,2019-10-16 17:39:00

Not saying the ends justify the means, but as someone who used to hop diet to diet, they *all* make these claims. For some reason it's only when it's vegan does the public (not saying you) get upset about it, in my experience.

Personally, I do think it really helps, but no, not overnight. Even cutting out dairy didn't help my skin overnight, but it certainly did over a few weeks when I'd had issues my entire life.

2931,StickInMyCraw,"\&gt;   Do you have a citation for this statement?

Look at how many US workers are employed producing goods vs services over time. For decades the services sector has been growing and growing to the point now that the vast majority of workers are not producing physical goods but rather services and intellectual property type goods. This applies to consumption as well - more people are seeing doctors, getting educations, and buying other services rather than buying more physical goods. If you google this you'll find a million different lenses to view this shift that all point to the same conclusion, whether it's the fastest-growing industries/occupations or just the raw % of GDP composed of goods vs services.

For simplicity, Wikipedia lists services as making up 80.2% of the US GDP in 2017, and this is a growing number since services growth overtook manufacturing growth some 60-70 years ago.

I think overall it’s a well done documentary and I like that it takes the health approach tailored towards athletes because I have talked to people who are athletes and their concern is usually not getting enough calories and protein to build muscle and maintain energy and this helps address them we concerns. 

However, I think they took it a bit too far. Is going plant based really going to make your time on battle ropes go from 8min to 1hr+ or make an injury magically heal? It might help but it’s not typically a magical overnight fix. It’s like someone saying that an investment will give you 100x return and make you rich... it might actually be be a good investment but things that sound ‘too good to be true’ usually start to raise concern. 

The science is there that it is a healthier way to live, it’s obviously a more ethical way to go for animals and the environment. Let’s rely on those facts

My ""melted butter"" was the product MELT. After mixing, it was pretty thick so I added some unsweet almond milk until it was consistency for the waffle iron.

I 'winged it' on the PB&amp;J. PB was 1 cup almond milk with 1/2 cup natural PB, with about 1/4 cup coconut sugar. The ""J"" was 1 bag of frozen berries in the Ninja with enough water to make it pourable. I cooked both the PB and the J in sauce pans.

&gt;Reduction of suffering is the success factor I'm looking for. If suddenly 90% of the world becomes vegan but we all treat each other shitty and say things like ""fuck off bootlicker"" without having gotten to know why someone thinks some way, then there really is no point. Life will still suffer and atrocities will likely still be committed. Changing human mentalities first and foremost is important I think, it leads to things like Veganism. Veganism for the sake of itself standing alone is great, but only a small part of a bigger solution to a lot of suffering.

Are you reducing suffering by being an agreeable bystander? No. You might notice that the person you came to ""defend"" has been having an ongoing conversation with me about veganism in this very thread. What about you, though? What has your carnist apologism accomplished? It's fine and dandy to talk about ""changing human mentalities"" and being ""part of a bigger solution"" but at some point you have to actually engage with others and not just criticize the way that others engage.

If you really cared about healing the world, you could have *been* the kinder person who replied to the omni about veganism instead of just saying that there *were* kinder vegans out there. To me, it seemed like you cared more about the perception of being kind than actually being a kind person.

3095,fnovd,"As someone who also loves to cook, let me go ahead and tell you that there are thousands of delicious meals you've never tried to make because your culture tells you that you need to put animal products in everything you eat. Salt, fat, and heat are all you need and none of them require any animals to die. Try cooking vegan meals every day for a month, and even if you stop after that I guarantee that you'll find stuff you'll want to make again and again. There are easy ways to replace eggs and milk in most dishes, it just takes some practice. There are vegan cooking subreddits where people can help you with specific dishes.

People always think that it's limiting, but really think about all the different cuisines and dishes in the world versus everything you've eaten in your life so far. You've probably only seen a small slice of what's out there. Eating animal products 3x a day is a recent norm, so most cuisines around the world have many different ways to make delicious food without them. Indian dishes are a great place to start due to the high number of vegetarians there.

The obsession with dishes that use animal flesh, milk, or eggs is its own limitation. It's like saying your favorite drinks have high fructose corn syrup and that you don't know how you could enjoy refreshments that don't use it or use ""high-fructose corn syrup alternatives"". Those are just called sugars! If protein and fat are what you want, there are hundreds of plant-based foods that will provide them. Plant-based alternatives make transitioning easier and help with recreating some old favorites but if you love to cook you won't need them nearly as often as you think.

&gt;I still think human-against-human crime is more troubling than human-against-animal crime (even though it is still awful).

I'm not sure why you felt the need to bring this up. This is not an either/or. How does removing animal products from your diet make you care less about human-against-human crime? You don't have to accept that non-human animals are equal to humans in order to care about non-human animals.

I went vegan halfway through eating an egg. 

I had already contemplated giving up dairy because I realized that it was giving me a lot of health issues (chronic sinusitis), so I had been browsing this sub reddit for recipe ideas that didn't include dairy. Anyways, I was part way through eating my breakfast when I looked up and saw my parrot staring at me. 

Now, she was probably figuring out the best way to get to my toast, but all the sudden it clicked. I love that bird more than most things in life, she is everything to me. She's my best friend. And it doesn't matter how smart or wonderful or affectionate she is, if she produced eggs large enough for humans to enjoy eating, we would have never met. She would have lived and died in a tiny, dingy, filthy cage in a giant warehouse, physically manipulated into overproducing eggs until her body gave up. Then someone would have eaten the corpse. 

I gave her some toast, gave her love and head scratches, then walked over to my fridge and threw away all of my non-vegan food. Straight up threw it in the garage or gave it away to friends.

That was it for me. Haven't looked back since, it's been almost a year. After a couple weeks of being a secret vegan, I told my husband. I told him that he could continue to eat however he liked, but that I would be no longer cooking non-vegan food, and that if he would like some, he would have to prepare at himself.

It took me about 5 years of manipulating her back into letting me cut out a certain meat product at a time.

* ""But I don't want to eat pigs anymore. The poor little piggies, I can't mum."" ""Okay, but as long as you eat everything else.""

* ""I think I'll just eat fish and seafood now and cut out everything else.""

By the time I was around 10 and cut out fish finally and she caught on, she put her foot down once again, but didn't realise that my entire childhood she'd been teaching me how to cook and I didn't need her to make my choices for me anymore.

I think this advert can only be good for normalising meat-free diets for children who have highly resistant parents.

3114,StickInMyCraw,"\&gt;  Yea, frankly, I'm not even interested in the growth argument from the pure aspect of GDP. If you're imagining a world in which software development is literally the only form of global growth, then whatever. I'm not really interested in postulating about a future thousands of years in the future when we know there's existential threats to deal with way before that. 

As I've said repeatedly this isn't a hypothetical, this is the current driver of growth in advanced economies today and has been for many years. US growth is not driven by producing more widgets. Software/digital goods is one part of that, but the larger part is just services more generally. Hiring a lawyer, going to a therapist, seeing a doctor, etc. An economy with more doctors and therapists and tattoo artists and physical trainers is growing without being linked to growth in energy use. 

Again, this is not postulating, this is the world we are currently living in.

Why do we have to have fewer doctors to continue living on this planet? Why do we have to have fewer youtube videos to continue living on this planet? Why do we have to have fewer teachers to continue living on this planet?

We have to reduce \*emissions\*, yes. It doesn't matter how many times you insist that consumption = emissions or growth = emissions, it is demonstrably untrue.

3129,Thefuhreroflaughs,"I think where we differ here is my view: I don't love all animals, I don't value all animals right to live the same. I don't velieve that death is innately wrong.

So your subjective moral standpoint, creates a dichotomy between your fundemental belief, that all animals are equal &amp; have the right to exist, and directly or indirectly participating in the death of animals. 

My subjective moral standing, doesn't create that dichotomy. I don't think all animals are equal, I don't think the death of an animal is innately wrong.

Being hypocritical is about contradicting yourself, or having a pretence of being often virtious. So If I had your moral view on this matter &amp; ate meat, I would be a hypocrite - but I don't. 

Having a preference of some animals &amp; having that dictate which you deem acceptable to keep as a pet &amp; which you deem food, Isn't hypocrtical. 

I get for you, it's just an entirely aribtrary distinction: Dog, Cat, Chicken, Horse, Pig. - All animals of equal value to you, so do condone the death of some for your consumption and not other is hypocritical. 

But I'm starting from the standpoint that I think killing animals for food is perfectly acceptable &amp; normal &amp; I think there is a clear logic to why we eat some and not others.

&gt;  valuing their right to live must be the same, otherwise I am placing ones right to live over the other, without a necessity, that is a hypocrisy.

So sit down with them and tell them why you want to switch to a more plant focused diet.  (Environment, animals, personal health, etc.) calmly don’t yell don’t preach parents do not like feeling like their child thinks they have the moral high ground (even if you do)

3184,badabingbadabang,"&gt; I think you’ve referenced suffering but that’s irrelevant to my point.   
&gt;  
&gt; I do think humans should kill animals, yes. I don’t think veganism should be the default. I do think a balanced life with respect for animals should be - I presume where we would differ if I think you can kill an animal and also respect it.   
&gt;  
&gt; 15,000 years ago they think we developed a domestication or dogs. Chickens it’s like 8k &amp; that was just to eat their eggs and them. We never domesticated dogs to eat. - so that’s my point about why historical context matters. Dogs aren’t really a food source and never have been whereas chickens always have been. 

Suffering is very directly linked to killing a sentient being and it's moral ramifications so, while it might not be relevant to your argument, it is relevant to the wider conversation but I'm happy to leave it out if you wish and we can argue why killing one animal and loving the other is hypocritical...

While I agree with you that we did need to kill chickens and cows to survive because then it was the most efficient way to get all required nutrients whilst putting in the minimum amount of effort, relatively speaking. We have several nutritional bodies that have very clearly stated that we can thrive on vegan diets as humans (I can source this if you wish) so I am able to make the claim that it is not necessary to kill an animal for food anymore. You have already argued that you wouldn't kill a dog and so I'm assuming you like or love animals. I feel that if you agree that you love animals then loving one and subjecting the other to death is a hypocrisy by definition. I'm not saying you have to love a chicken like you love a dog but you must respect the chicken's right to life in order to remain morally consistent.  
 

&gt; So it’s nothing to do with you owing your Labrador anything, or that fact it may suffer more. The point I’m making is: **it’s less natural there is a cultural and practical reason to not eat a dog and equally to eat a chicken**. Even though you don’t participate in either, surely you can understand that distinction? 

I can definitely understand this point of view because I was non-vegan myself not too long ago but I feel like you conflate *natural* and *cultural* here a little because one thing thing can be very natural but culturally unacceptable whereas something can be culturally practiced but extremely unnatural. Also, *Culture* in itself is very subjective and always changing that's why I feel like using it to drive a point further doesn't justify of why one animal needs to die where the other needs to live *i.e. what was right yesterday might not be right today*. If we were to consider *nature*, there are millions of obscene things that happen in nature which I'm sure you would have a strong moral stance against and again I don't feel like it can be used to justify why one animal needs to die and the other needs to live.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So it’s also not about someone’s but it absolutely is about an animals usefulness. To then compare it to humans is just ridiculous hyperbole. 

That's a fair point, it might be hyperbolic and I did not mean to be crass, but in order to determine what is and isn't morally consistent we need to apply it to a context which is relevant to humans to make it a bit more relatable, hence, why I asked your feelings on extending your logic to human beings.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  But that’s because I don’t value all animal in the way you do &amp; I don’t think the death of an animal is innately wrong 

But this would be a moral inconsistency ... I don't have to value the animals exactly the same, but valuing their right to live must be the same, otherwise I am placing ones right to live over the other, without a necessity, that is a hypocrisy.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 14:53:06

A bit of a clarification: The 65 billion land animals killed worldwide per year are land animal that people have *systematically bred into existence to be killed*. While its practice is environmentally destructive and one of the main contributors to the sixth mass extinction, that number of land animals killed per does not really figure into the numbers of free-living being killed in the extinction itself. However, most of the trillions of sea animals are free-living animals that we are killing off, so that number does figure into the extinction numbers; keep in mind, though that still tens to hundreds of billions of sea animals are farmed worldwide per year, i.e. tens to hundreds of billions of sea animals are bred to be used and killed.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 14:42:39

3201,StickInMyCraw,"\&gt;  I don't think abandoning anything entirely is necessary to avert climate change, but software isn't meeting a base need, and it requires hardware to run. Right now, Electricity is directly related to climate change, and until we change our viewpoint on nuclear, that will continue to be the case. 

I think we're getting bogged down into the weeds here. The marginal cost in terms of energy used for an update to Microsoft Excel is negligible (maybe even negative), but that is still a significant contributor to growth. Opening a yoga studio is not inherently linked to increased emissions, yet that is growth. And as I said before, these aren't fringe cases - this is literally how America and other advanced economies have been growing for quite some time now. In short, growth can be infinite without increasing emissions because the driver of growth is now in services and goods whose value is not a function of the fuel used to create them.

\&gt;  I'm saying that the problems literally can't be solved without doing so. It's not that it's easier, it's that it's necessary. 

I mean earlier you were explicitly saying the reason we had to approach climate change with a complete economic reorientation was because carbon taxes were too politically unstable, which implies the former is more politically stable.

As long as you add enough liquid so it doesn't all steam off while cooking, it's pretty much impossible to burn anything because they don't get hot enough to, so you can add all the ingredients for a recipe, and walk away from it, only having to come back to add some liquid, or when it's done.  If that appeals to you (and especially if you're okay eating a lot of soups, stews, and other dishes with liquid) a cookbook to look up is ""The Super Easy Vegan Slow Cooker Cookbook"" by Toni Okamoto.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 14:39:48

3260,Re_Re_Think,"This is a 42 minute video so I'm not going to watch the whole thing, but I did watch the first 10 minutes, and here is a response: 

--------

Veganism is not a diet, but there are lots of indications that this person did not check to make sure that their raw, plant based diet was nutritionally complete.  This includes everything from their descriptions of early negative problems: 

&gt; went to bed hungry... leg pain... dry itchy skin

To the unreliable sources of information that she used:  

* [David Wolfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wolfe_(raw_food_advocate\))
* [Dr. Doug Graham](https://atheistforums.org/thread-29438.html)
* [Dr. Brian Clement](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/florida-tells-brian-clement-to-stop-practicing-medicine/) 

The controversy surrounding these individuals is easy to find and check, and their ideas do not represent what the larger scientific community thinks about the viability of plant based diets, the current scientific consensus of which has been established to be that well planned veganism [is healthy for all stages of life](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/dieteticorgs).  


To her misunderstanding or misuse of other terms and ideas in medicine beyond nutrition, like for example:

&gt; It's just detox...I really bought into this idea that you're toxic, and you've got to cleanse...

This sentence doesn't make any sense, nutritionally or medically speaking.  

&gt; [Clearing up an ovarian cyst with Chinese herbs when I was 19]... [Choosing fasting and juicing as the primary treatment for a cyst]... oil pulling

These are unscientific practices which do not make sense, and which may have further contributed to her deterioration of health.  For example, oil pulling is not the same and not as effective as brushing your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste, and may have contributed to her cavity development.  

Plant based diets (even healthy, well-planned ones) do not promise to prevent all disease from ever occurring (they lower the risk of developing some, but they do not eliminate it), and expecting them to (or dietary change to be able to fix every medical condition) is not realistic.  

&gt; raw eggs

It is a very basic, well-known fact that eating things like raw eggs (and other raw food) can increase the risk of food borne illness, like Salmonella poisoning, and turning to using them instead of checking to see whether her nutrition was complete by talking to a reliable doctor is another indication that she doesn't have a very good understanding of basic nutrition or medicine, and probably wasn't eating appropriately beforehand.  

-------

&gt; [Some meanness when stopping the plant based diet]... Just sharing your experience

""Just sharing your experience"" is not an excuse to spread misinformation.  She should not have been bullied or harassed, or anything of that nature if she was, but spreading incorrect information has dangerous effects that can end up hurting others, and it should be objected to, or else it can cause people to believe incorrect things, and make choices which end up hurting themselves or others.  

What I watched of the video didn't get into it much, but it could have been both valid and useful if someone were to have told her at that point in time that she needed to do a better job of planning her diet, and that means checking the nutritional quality of it by looking at the actual nutrients, not just eating rawer foods. 

--------

This is a person who seems to have ignored mainstream medical advice without good reason, instead relying on alternative naturopathy.  

Unfortunately, there are quacks waiting in the fringes of any dietary group (you can find them for versions of omnivore diets, too) waiting to prey upon those who can't or won't check their nutritional intake or don't want to use or believe other conclusions of modern medicine, but the terrible fact that badly planned diets exist and can be followed superstitiously by some people does not invalidate- or even say anything at all- about the scientific evidence supporting healthy, well-planned plant-based diets.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 13:59:55

3282,kittenmittens4865,"First of all, if your diet was just meat and avocados, that would be pretty awful too. Lots of vital nutrients would be missing. 

Second, if you suddenly switch to all plants (especially when you eat lots of foods known to potentially cause digestive issues, like beans, berries, leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, etc.), yeah, you’re gonna have diarrhea. Your body isn’t used to the fiber. And if all you ate before was meat and avocados, I can imagine it wouldn’t go well. Many vegans had stomach/digestive issues making the switch, especially when doing whole food plant based. You just have to give your body time to adjust, and maybe transition gradually instead. Even avocados have a lot of fat and can cause diarrhea if you eat too many. 

There are literally zero amino acids available in meat that can’t be found in a (common, easily found) plant food. I’m not sure if you came up with that or if it’s something your doctor said, but it’s not correct.

**Your Fallacy:**

&gt;we are omnivores **(ie: Humans are omnivores)**



**Response:**

The claim that humans are natural meat-eaters is generally made on the belief that we have evolved the ability to digest meat, eggs and milk. This is true as far as it goes; as omnivores, we're physiologically capable of thriving with or without animal flesh and secretions. However, this also means that we can thrive on a whole food plant-based diet, which is what humans have also been doing throughout our history and prehistory.
Even if we accept at face value the premise that man is a natural meat-eater, this reasoning depends on the claim that if a thing is natural then it is automatically valid, justified, inevitable, good, or ideal. Eating animals is none of these things. Further, it should be noted that many humans are lactose intolerant, and many doctors recommend a plant-based diet for optimal health. When you add to this that taking a sentient life is by definition an ethical issue - especially when there is no actual reason to do so - then the argument that eating meat is natural falls apart on both physiological and ethical grounds.)

Do you honestly not think early Homo sapiens were savage by today’s standards, or are you just trying to derail the discussion?   

Here is (citation you asked for re: cannibalism](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/06/prehistoric-cannibalism-not-just-driven-by-hunger-study-reveals) a decent article about cannibalism in the Palaeolithic era.  
It addresses that we can not know when it was carried out for survival or ritual or a combination of reasons, but there is absolutely no question that it happened with enough frequency that the scarce remains from the era provide evidence:   

&gt;Evidence of cannibalism, in the form of cut marks, tooth marks and tell-tale bone breakage has been found at a number of prehistoric sites, including in France, Spain and Belgium, revealing that our ancestors as well as other hominins such as Neanderthals and Homo antecessor at least occasionally ate each other.

Multiple that by over 300 million people. 

That’s how you get the sixth extinction that we’re going through. There are 65 billion animals and trillions of sea animals killed worldwide every year. In less than 2 decades, that a trillion land animals and tens of trillions of sea animals. The death toll and suffering we’re inflicting on the animal kingdom is astounding and beyond horrific. 

Abraham Lincoln said that what characterized the attitude of slaveowners in the South was a “Might makes Right” philosophy. Same essentially applies to the philosophy of the Nazi’s, of rapists. What characterizes the philosophy of people supporting violence towards animals? Why do they believe they have a right to inflict violence? Why do they believe that an animal’s body, their leg, their chest, their wings, is really their possession? Is that not “Might makes Right”?

If I could go back and communicate with myself from a decade ago, I’d say be proud of who you are, especially if you’re trying to do the right thing, as best as you understand it. That’s the only thing I dislike about having tried to be more socially accepted (everything else was positive) 

Or as MLK put it: “Never, never be afraid to do what's right, especially if the well-being of a person or animal is at stake. Society's punishments are small compared to the wounds we inflict on our soul when we look the other way.”

And it's really not that difficult or inconvenient, instead of thinking of it as 'vegan food' think about it as non-animal based foods.

So many great things you can still eat. Potatoes and rice are incredible staples and both can be prepared in hugely diverse ways.
Vegetable stir fry is just as amazing as any other stir fry and curries are a wild world of taste.

I also had the fear of coming out to the family, but family dinners just turned into making up a bunch of extra sides for me to have as a main.

It's difficult to start, but you'll feel great once you do, and it wasn't until I changed my diet over that I began to actually start putting on weight where previously I was underweight, and it's because I actually started enjoying my food.

3512,NicolasName,"Was a kind, friendly (misinformed) vegetarian for 8 years. Broke vegetarian diet twice for 2-3 years. 

Been an outspoken vegan and convinced my immediate family to adopt a strict vegan lifestyle. 

In the beginning, I was trying to be nice, but at a certain point with my family, I realized that “being nice” meant diluting the argument and becoming easier to ignore. 

Veganism is psychologically uncomfortable. I was shaking and incredibly nervous when my animal-eating family member told me about culling of baby calves and chicks. I felt that I had done something terribly wrong for the last decade. I felt like a huge moron afterwards for not having done 2-3 more google searches when deciding to go vegetarian. My body was shaking. 

I imagine other non-vegans go through something similar when the topic comes up, and it makes everyone a bit uncomfortable, and it makes people defensive and resistant, so they can protect their emotions. I get that, but on the other hand, I get that the average American is responsible for killing over 400 animal lives per year due to diet alone. It’s a tough balancing act. 

I think the meme of the “annoying vegan” is just someone whose focused more on the animals than the emotions of the person in front of them. I don’t think that totally invalidating what they’re doing or making it less effective, however. MLK has 40% disapproval rating in 1963, and 67% in 1966. That’s because he was challenging the public with regards to mistaken, unkind views, and that’s always difficult for those engaging in unkind acts to hear, since we want to view ourselves as kind, just people. His advocacy involves loud protests, him ending up in jail, etc. It was always pretty and non-confrontational, and he said that in opposing injustice and violence, all forms of resistance is acceptable, so long as it’s non-violent. I would say that being annoying is ok, so long as one is able to remain active and express non-violent ideas, such as the veganism (or non-violent diet).

A few friends and I have reported the Patreon page, emailed Patreon directly, and made attempts to contact them on Twitter. We can't allow this page that subsists on abuse and endangerment to stay up.

In short of what they are doing, they are taking hamsters with a abusively small enclosure and sticking them underwater in a poorly ventilated death trap. They are soon planning on chucking these poor animals inside a lake as well. They stream on twitch and have a youtube channel i will leave links to those at the bottom

Log in to Patreon (must be logged in to report), find the page ([https://www.patreon.com/hampture](https://www.patreon.com/hampture)) and select report for harmful activity. None of the specific report options exactly apply, but any report should alert their support team.

Email- The message: One of the creators on Patreon (can be found at [https://www.patreon.com/hampture](https://www.patreon.com/hampture)) has used your website to build a platform to fund animal abuse. The creator in question's content centers on videos of hamsters placed in abusively small enclosures, then those enclosures are placed inside fish tanks full of water.

What I mean is that when talking to people who are either not vegan at all or maybe some vein of vegetarian I think we should be friendly and non judgemental in our approach to convincing people. 

I mean I guess the same applies to atheism, what Richard Dawkins says, we need the aggressive in your face kind of approach to people, but we defintely also need a more soft, friendly and polite approach. We can have a healthy balance. I think that atheism started with the former but I think generally now theres a good balance (I know some people may disagree but I personally find the ""face"" and image of atheism to be much less toxic than it once was).

3551,Thefuhreroflaughs," I think you’ve referenced suffering but that’s irrelevant to my point.  

I do think humans should kill animals, yes. I don’t think veganism should be the default. I do think a balanced life with respect for animals should be - I presume where we would differ if I think you can kill an animal and also respect it.  

I don’t think it’s fundamentally wrong to kill animals for food and obviously you do so that’s the crux of our disagreement.  

Your point about what we used to do historically isn’t relevant either. My point was humans and dogs are more closely linked than chickens, they respond to our facial movements, we can train them. It’s been a symbiotic relationship. They’re literally known as man’s best friend.  

15,000 years ago they think we developed a domestication or dogs. Chickens it’s like 8k &amp; that was just to eat their eggs and them. We never domesticated dogs to eat. - so that’s my point about why historical context matters. Dogs aren’t really a food source and never have been whereas chickens always have been. 

So it’s nothing to do with you owing your Labrador anything, or that fact it may suffer more. The point I’m making is: it’s less natural there is a cultural and practical reason to not eat a dog and equally to eat a chicken. Even though you don’t participate in either, surely you can understand that distinction?  

So it’s also not about someone’s but it absolutely is about an animals usefulness. To then compare it to humans is just ridiculous hyperbole.  

Thing is I am anti the mass production of meat. I don’t think meat should be cheap, or easily available. I think the fact you can buy like 30 chicken wings for £3 is terrible. I just don’t think eating meat is immoral and I don’t think saying I’d eat a chicken but not a dog is hypocritical .

It’s worth noting that Lewis Hamilton was criticised for becoming vegan and many suggested he’d struggle to last the very tough races because he’d be physically less capable than the others. Since he went vegan he’s won over half the races, broken nearly every record going and is set to become the most successful driver in history. Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Virat Kohli.

&gt;WILD ANIMALS DONT EVER DIE OF OLD AGE.

I agree that it's rare, but one should be careful with absolutes. Still doesn't change the fact that a shot from a hunter is the ""cleanest"" kill, or even a kill at all.

&gt;Second there is no way that planting massive fields of crops that would NEVER grow in the wild like that is healthy for the environment and it undoubtedly also leads to climate change.

You're right, but you're completely missing the part where 80-90% of grown crops goes to animals as feed. [Src](https://www.simply-live-consciously.com/english/food-resources/food-consumption-of-animals/).

&gt;You really want low impact then yes hunting your meat and growing your vej is the best way

Maybe for one person, but it's not sustainable for the global population. We would not have enough animals, as I showed you in my other comment. You can't just go with one specific case, you need to see how the whole worlds population can adapt. Especially since you put one person hunting vs ""planting massive fields of crop"". With that logic, I could say ""Well, if we just grow crops with hydroponics and/or use indoor farms that utilize height in an environment without animal interference we have much less impact than hunters!!"". This would be true, but is no way ready for full-scale production for the entire world.

&gt;Andy way healthier for you than a pure vegan diet

Every major health organization recognize that a vegan diet can be just as healthy as a traditional diet. This includes WHO, ADA etc. [You can look through this link](https://youaretheirvoice.com/pages/the-clear-consensus)

&gt;factory farming is also fucked

Agreed.

&gt;but it’s also bullshit to say vegans “thrive” there’s a reason athletes don’t eat vegan

What about [Patrik Baboumian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Baboumian), who is a vegan strongman and won ""Germany's Strongest Man""?

Or [Kendrick Farris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Farris), the only weightlifter to qualify for the USA in the 2016 Olympics (and broke the US record)?

Or [Mac Danzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Danzig), the MMA who has 22 wins over 35 matches? (Other vegan UFC/MMA fighters are Nick Diaz, Nate Diaz, Abel Trujillo).

Or [Venus Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Williams) who has 7 single and 14 double Womens Grand Slams, plus 5 Wimbledon single wins, and 4 Olympic gold medals?

Or [Steph Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steph_Davis) one of the worlds leading climbers? (first woman who have soloed a 5.11 grade climb among other things).

Or [Scott Jurek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Jurek) who holds the world record for the 2,189-mile Appalachian Trail, winning 24 ultra-marathons, and being the first american to win the Spartathlon?

I could go on. It doesn't matter where you get your nutrients from, just that you get them.

&gt;till you get k2 and b12 deficient

Vitamin K deficiency is very rare, and *""Vitamin K1, also called phylloquinone, is mostly found in plant foods like leafy green vegetables. It makes up about 75–90% of all vitamin K consumed by humans""[Src](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23590754)*. K2 is more easily absorbed, but this is not a problem for most people. The body also converts K1 to K2, as well as producion some in your large intestine (even if it's probably a negligible amount). [Src](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1492156) And if it against all odds is needed; you can get it from fermented food such as natto, sauerkraut, kimchi.

Vitamin B12 is more common, but considering that a lot of non-vegan foods are fortified, as well as giving some supplements to certain animals (such as cattle at CAFOs and some sheep)[Src](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/livestock-biosecurity/cobalt-deficiency-sheep-and-cattle) it seems easier to just eat a suppliment once a week (or eat fortified non-animal foods). Considering 6% of Americans under 60 was B12 deficient in 2014 [Src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12_deficiency) whilst only 0.5% of the population in 2016 was vegan; B12 deficiency is a serious problem all around.

&gt;it’s also clear that animal products have the most nutrient dense foods humans can eat

Depends. Generally yes, but since it takes more than 10x the crops to produce, it's still worse for the environment. And, if we take seitan for example, we have a vegan food that is almost analogous to meat, with 0 cholesterol [Src](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/seitan#allergies).

Soy is also a good food as it contains all essential amino acids, and is recommended as a dietary substitution for higher-fat animal products. [Src](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19145965).

Soups and pasta can be both premade or there's low effort options at home.

I don’t think ever once someone said, “no, I won’t have the steak, bob over there is mean mugging me and I think I should make a dietary change.”  Most Americans do the opposite of just that. Oh, I shouldn’t have meat, bob? I’ll take the biggest steak you have in your kitchen. I think it’s these shaming tactics that make the general public dislike vegans. Almost all world religions have the forethought that you win people over kindness and not by shame or force. It instantly turns people off to any ideas you have on the subject. Real change takes time, education and patience. Just my thoughts. Maybe I’m wrong... maybe yelling at “murderer” at people trying to buy milk in your grocery store is a good tactic.

Most of the older generation have been brainwashed and beaten down with fear to see the truth of things. Now lets go into the bible.........

The Old Testament God, Lord God, is not True God. Lord God kills! True God does not. Lord God taught humans to kill and eat animals. Lord God loves the smell of burnt flesh, its why those animal sacrifices were commanded. Lord God is Satan in my opinion. A liar and a murderer. 

True God came down into flesh in the body of Jesus to show humans the way. Not only vegan but Jesus was the first ever VEGAN ACTIVIST!  And ultimately it is what got him killed.

When Jesus went into the temple, caused a scene, tossed the money tables, his real motive was to denounce ritiustic animal sacrifice. All the caged animals in there were being sold to be sacrificed for passover. Not the way of True God. In essence Jesus's death amounts to this.

I dunno about this poster but I was like this for a couple months before I became *strictly* vegan and before that the reason was mainly that at the time I was living in a country that made it borderline impossible to be ""as vegan"" as I can be in my home country.

Veganism is defined by not harming animals as much as practicable, but ""practicable"" might not be the same for everyone and is extremely wishy-washy to begin with. Like I still am on hormonal birth control to treat my PCOS and the pills contain lactose, and even though health conditions are respected by most, some would probably think I'm still not vegan enough.

Anyway, if people just eat regular diets containing animal products and label themselves vegan they deserve to be called out of course because they're really not making any effort at all. But when someone might be like for example ""95-99% vegan"" or talks about hypothetically possibly eating a fish and we say ""ugh you're not vegan"" I think we should question if that's not just hardcore gatekeeping to make ourselves feel better and our energy may be used better elsewhere.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 07:05:48

To which I had to ask, multiple times, in what way PETA incited people to violence, intentionally or not.

In response the individual repeatedly insisted that they were speaking in general terms and had no obligation to explain how this applied to PETA. Then they quickly left the conversation, insisting they'll keep hating PETA all the same. Basic failures of logic seem really common when people try to justify their own terrible behaviors.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 07:04:42
3665,borahorzagobuchol,"I have collected together a list of news sources and other third parties reporting on many of the animals PETA has saved as a response to the common ""they don't even help animals"" and ""they kill more animals than they save"". It is only a partial run-through of their ""milestones"" page and still needs to be finished. However, it could easily be made into a list of ""things that aren't happened today because of PETA"" instead.

* They [saved bears](https://www.globalanimal.org/2014/12/11/rescued-bears-feel-freedom-for-first-time/) from abuse in an illegal tourist trap in Tennessee and transferred them to a wildlife sanctuary. - **2**

* Their investigations led to the closing of [Professional Laboratory Research Services](https://our-compass.org/2010/09/14/professional-laboratory-and-research-services-plrs-protest-information/) when they uncovered evidence of dogs, cats and rabbits being kicked, thrown, stomped on, thrown into cages, picked up by their throats and screamed at. This led to the release of 250 dogs and cats. Of course, this also ended the ongoing abuse of from that point to today, so we'll just put a ""+"" to represent this. - **252+**

* They supplied evidence of physical abuse and negligence that led to a suit by the USDA and the Hawthorn Corporation was forced to relinquish 11 circus elephants [to an animal sanctuary](https://www.elephants.com/news/elenotes/posts/the-hawthorn-herd-at-the-sanctuary-then-to-now). - **263+**

* As a result of campaigns and many undercover videos of fur farms, PETA convinced [Polo Ralph Lauren](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13211592/ns/business-us_business/t/polo-ralph-lauren-pull-fur-collections/) as well as [Vivienne Westwood and Tommy Hilfiger](http://www.ecorazzi.com/2012/03/27/7-fur-free-fashion-designers/) and [Calvin Klein and Eddie Bauer](http://www.second-opinion-doc.com/the-history-of-petas-anti-fur-campaign.html) to stop using fur. As well as being one of the groups that pressured San Francisco city council to [ban fur sales](https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/san-francisco-becomes-largest-u-s-city-to-ban-the-sale-of-new-fur-apparel-and-accessories-1202634030/). ? (hard to put a number on this one, but assuming the knock-on effect from these fashion companies dropping fur had only a 1% effect on all fur trade, that would be [10.5 million every single year](https://www.lcanimal.org/index.php/campaigns/fur/fur-trade-facts). So, again ultra conservative as this had been many more years in several cases, let's say this only happened a single year, rather than a much more realistic 10 years average, or 105 million) - **10,020,263++**

* An investigation by PETA led to the [closing of Global Captive Breeders](https://katenews2day.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/cruel-exotic-reptile-breeder-global-captive-breeders-owner-mitchell-steven-behm-charged-with-animal-cruelty-after-20000-rats-and-reptiles-in-deplorable-conditions-were-rescued-from-their-california/), after they found deplorable conditions that led to the arrest of the operator and two individuals each being charged with more than 100 counts of felony animal cruelty. This in turn led to the rescue of 20,000 rats and reptiles. Again, this one was years ago, so another ""+"" for the animals not abused from that date to today. **10,040,263+++**

* [Their investigations into the production of antitoxin](http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/oct/06/horses-in-india-being-subjected-to-abuse-for-antitoxins-antivenins-peta-1525716.html) in India uncovered  horses, mules and donkeys with poor nutrition, poor dental care, digestive tract diseases, skin diseases, painful lesions, and other severe abnormalities. As a result of these investigations PETA has funded research into [laboratory sourced diptheria anti-toxin](https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/peta-science-consortium-funds-non-animal-antitoxin-research/). We have no way of knowing how many animals this will save, but I think it is reasonable to conclude that it could work and could save a very large number in the future. Another ""+"". **10,040,263++++**

* They convinced the US military to [enact a permanent ban on using dogs and cats](https://www.army-technology.com/features/featureputting-an-end-to-cruel-danish-bacon-animal-wounding-exercises-4505465/) in its ""wound labs"" in which they would shoot, stab and dismember animals. PETA also supplied the data which helped stop the Norweigan, German, Polish and Bolivian armed forces from continuing similar labs. Another really hard one to estimate, but at least 100s of animals for each instance. So we'll say a bare minimum of 400, and of course the future for another ""+"". **10,040,663+++++**

* They helped lead a campaign to [pressure Taiwan into introducing its first law against cruelty to animals](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/an-end-to-animal-cruelty-in-taiwan/). Saving untold numbers of strays from drowning, poisoning, electrocution, bludgeoning or having sulfuric acid thrown on them. Another ""+"". **10,040,663++++++**

* They organized a grassroots campaign, congressional testimony, and scientific documentation that led the EPA to spare between [600,000-1.2 million](https://www.mediapeta.com/peta/pdf/Mean-Greenies-Issues-Paper-pdf.pdf) animals from chemical toxicity testing in the high production volume chemical-testing program. **10,640,663++++++**

* PETA convinced the Gap Inc., J.Crew, Liz Claiborne and Clarks to [stop purchasing leather from India](https://www.just-style.com/news/leather-council-loses-28m-over-animal-rights-concerns_id75258.aspx), whose production was [particularly cruel](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/how-indias-sacred-cows-are-beaten-abused-and-poisoned-to-make-leather-for-high-street-shops-724696.html). Again, an untold but likely huge number of animals whose continued breeding was given stark economic disincentive. Another ""+"". **10,640,663+++++++**

* PETA organized the ""[cap their stacks](https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1995-1.gif?20151027062532)"" campaign, convincing Mobil, Texaco, Pennzoil, Shell to cap their stacks to avoid birds and bats being burned to death. Untold numbers, PETA claims ""[millions](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/history/)"", but lets be incredibly conservative and say only 1 million, which, given the [3 billion birds that have been lost in North America alone since 1970](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/19/3-billion-fewer-birds-north-america-now-than-1970/2365747001/), would be a drop in the bucket. **11,750,663+++++++**

* They helped with a campaign that saved 6 polar bears that were underfed, whipped, and [forced to perform in sweltering temperatures](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-mar-10-mn-32081-story.html). **11,750,669+++++++**

* After a lengthy campaign PETA helped convince [Pepsico and Coca-Cola to stop testing on animals](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cocacola-peta-idUSN3047085120070531). ""+"" **11,750,669++++++++**

* PETA led an investigation into U.S. Global Exotics that led to the seizure of more than [26,000 animals by US authorities](https://animalhoardinginfo.blogspot.com/2009/12/thousands-of-exotic-animals-seized-from.html) who were overcrowded and ""deprived of basic needs, such as food, water, clean bedding, and heat ."" **11,776,669+++++++++**

The largest of these numbers by far would be in a very small population increase in the number of vegetarians and vegans over the decades as a result of heavy campaigning by PETA that entire time. But since PETA has been aggressively dogged by an animal industry front group [spreading misinformation on astroturf sites](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/PETA_Kills_Animals), it would be hard to come to even a very conservative estimate of the number of vegans/vegetarians they have contributed to the [explosive growth of meat-free diets since 2015](https://wtvox.com/lifestyle/2019-the-world-of-vegan-but-how-many-vegans-are-in-the-world/).",1,vegan,2019-10-16 06:59:05

Here are some [recipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/aewr4d/advice_for_allergic_vegans/edtjxov/?context=3) for soy and nuts, the most common of your allergies.  For the other ones you're better off finding individual substitutions where possible.  

&gt; typical sources of protein

Besides soy, if he can have every other bean there will be plenty of options, plus other additional [sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/bogr1j/i_want_to_go_vegan_but_i_dont_want_to_negatively/eni38ng/) of protein.  

&gt; pears of every kind... celery - pepper - anise

Anise: What you can use as a substitute depends on whether you're talking about Pimpinella anisum ([Aniseed](https://www.google.com/search?q=Pimpinella+anisum&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X)) or Illicium verum (Chinese [Star Anise](https://www.google.com/search?q=Illicium+verum&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X)).  If it's the first one (and the allergy to celery indicates it is) you may not be able to use foods like fennel or caraway, as they are botanically related and may cause a similar reaction.  

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9420134

Otherwise, liquorice or summer savory can be flavor substitutes. 

Celery: There are a number of plants that taste like celery but they come from the same family and shouldn't be used: it's better to just omit this flavor.  For the texture, in some cases a mild tasting finely chopped lettuce (like Romaine or Iceburg) can be a substitute.  Don't ever use celery seed or celery salt, as these can contain more of the allergens than fresh celery.  

Pears: Apples and Quince are related to pears, but not as closely as the above examples.  They don't have exactly the same taste, but have a similar texture, and cooking properties.  If he doesn't have an allergic reaction to apples, peel and use them, as they're cheap and widely available; if he does, don't try to use them (any new exposure should be done under the supervision of a doctor, if at all).  

Bell Peppers: There aren't many good substitutes that I know of.  Be sure to also avoid the spice paprika, which is made from peppers.   

-------

Sometimes with many restrictions, people focus too heavily on what they can't have, rather than what they can.  An exercise which can switch the way you think about food is writing (or researching) a long list of all the things you can have (grains, beans and legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices, etc), rather than the ones you can't.

Yeah I do find it pretty shit that I know I’m eating an animal that died and most likely suffered a horrible death and had a poor quality of life but I guess that’s just the way it is and our body can still benefit from some meat consumption imo as long as it’s not too much and it’s in moderation so that we can still reduce environmental damage. My view is that it’s sad that animals die but I don’t think it’s too bad to cut down and just have a little bit of meat instead which is what so want to work towards but I 100% understand your reasoning.

3709,arcowhip,"There is a lot to unpack here. Going vegan as a teen is challenging because your parents control a lot of what your diet is (they typically buy all the food afterall). So if you wanna go vegan, the first place to start is to talk to them. 

You can expect that they may worry about your health primarily. In which case, it will be incumbent on you to show being vegan can be healthy (you don’t have to prove healthiest, just healthy enough). If they can agree to that they may agree to support you being vegan. The other thing to worry about is stuff like shampoo and toothpaste and clothing. But I recommend just start with food, and build from there. 

The other thing to consider is the “making a difference part.” Even if your actions won’t stop the death of animals, that does not justify continuing those actions. You can opt out of the system that is causing suffering. So whether or not it has an impact in the world is irrelevant to whether your personal actions align with what you think is right and wrong. 

And from that point, we can look at how your actions can have an impact. By living a life that abstains from the death and exploitation of animals, you broadcast to those around you that you don’t support those actions. You’re life then models the behavior you want. The reasons why you go vegan will be obvious to those who know you are. I find this at least inspires people to think about where their food comes from. 

And finally, from a concrete sense, your purchases increases demand for vegan products. The more that happens, the more these companies can continue to make the products. A ripple effect occurs where grocery stores stock vegan goods, restaurants serve vegan meals, friends and family members eat a vegan meal more often, the demand for other goods decrease (like dairy being overtaken by alternative milks). You’re a tiny atom in a big ole beast of an economy, but you’re tiny atom bonds to all the stuff around you. And that can have a big impact.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 05:21:34

But most of the time I make actual food lol. I enjoy vegan meats like tempeh, tofu, seitan, and other such things, and incorporate them into meals with lots of vegetables and grains. Ironically, vegans tend to eat a wider variety of foods than most omnis because we had to branch out and learn about many different foods and cuisines.

You might be interested in making your own homemade vegan meats. I've made my own filets/steaks, lunchmeats, sausages, roasts, and other styles of 'meat' using vital wheat gluten as the primary ingredient mixed with flavorings and spices. It's fun and inexpensive. I can't say homemade will taste like any animal meat, but it satisfies in the same way. I've personally taken to calling seitan ""unicorn meat"" because naturally no one has ever eaten unicorn so when meat eaters try it, there's no expectation that it will be like chicken or beef or whatever.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 05:08:21

-Hartbreakers, small take out or order at the counter, reasonably priced
-Toad Style, a local fav, kinda punk. Uncomfortable to sit in but do it anyway.
-No vegan food but go to House of Yes definitely. Friends of friends from my home town own it and they have the best dance parties.

Williamsburg:
-YOU MUST GO TO Modern Love it’s owned by Isa Chandra Moskowitz, the vegan punk GOAT, Veganomicon was THE cookbook to have when I started out. Service is whatever but the food is so good.

Crown Heights:
-Greedi Vegan: good neighborhood flavor
-Screamers Pizza. (location in Greenpoint too.) Must do... I love the buffalo ranch when I’m feelin decadent

East Village:
-Van Leeuwen has my fav vegan icecream but beware, the waffle cone is not vegan. (They have locations all over but this is my fav)
-El Diablito (small take out with beer and decent chips and guac/salsas) not vegan but doable or
-Rosie’s (THE BEST for happy hour, get to the bar early, it fills up, veggie tacos, great margs and salsas) if you want an options for a cheap compromise. (Also not completely vegan.)
There are 3 vegan restaurants right next to each other on 2nd Ave:
-Double Zero (pizza and the only one I can vouch for, pricey but good but nut based cheeses if ya wanna be SLIGHTLY healthier than Screamers, good if you like wine.)
Same owners have Asian and Mexican, places next door. 
-Peace Food Cafe: Some healthy vegan options, most delicious (I really like the squash sandwich but if your not into things tasting the way I imagine a 1960’s Birkenstock wearing frizzy haired hippie would, go for something else) definitely try THE BEST VEGAN CHEESECAKE I have ever had there.
-Orchard Grocer: all vegan sandwich shop and deli. Huge sandwiches on the fly. Next door to Moo shoes.
-Also not a vegan joint but a bar that kinda reminds me of the LES before the bros took it over: Mother’s Ruin... also your asshole friend can get what I hear is amazing bar food. Maybe the fries are vegan?

Three places I haven’t been but am dying to try:

-Seasoned Vegan in Harlem: know it’s a must do, just haven’t made it there yet.

-Dirt Candy (vegetarian/vegan), suppose to be amazing AND if your into that sort of thing the husband of the owner Grady Hendrix, has written some really campy horror books (pretty good) but wrote an anthology of old horror lit (amazing) and has started republishing some of the best stuff I have read in that genre.
 
-Delice &amp; Sarrisin: French vegan food. Hear it’s delicious and I am definitely intrigued as to how they pull it off.

Skip:
-Caravan of Dreams: worst service, mediocre food
-By Chloe: sucky vegan junk food (do hartbreakers instead) and rumor in the industry is her partners completely ripped her off and she no longer makes money from own gig.
-Someone will definitely try to drag you there... Champs is fine but completely overrated.
-Chickpea and Olive. Fucking ewww... seems okay at 1st bite and then it congeals. In your mouth.

I realized not long ago this is a skill that is far too lacking in the world, a lack that I myself am all too guilty of. I agree with you in a lot of ways I think. I don't want to open the Pandora's box that is my reasons why it is entirely moral to eat animals, one, for lack of verboseness on my part, and two, for the sheer length of the discussion this would entail. I will say, however, that I agree with you that dog breeding, and any other form of animal abuse, is cruel and evil. I also think that animal breeding the way it is done in the modern food industry is a form of animal abuse. I myself have grown up on a small hobby farm, where animals were virtually free to roam anywhere they wanted, and where their lives were happy and their deaths, sudden. So I guess I have a different perspective on the raising aspect of things, which also ties into the core of our disagreement.

INGREDIENTS

• 900g winter melon

• 300g brown sugar

INSTRUCTIONS

&amp;#x200B;

1. Clean the skin of the winter melon carefully and cut the winter melon into small pieces. Then put it in a large bowl, sprinkle with brown sugar and mix well.

2. Marinated the winter melon for two hours, then the winter melon will naturally produce water.

3. Pour it in a pot and cook under high heat until boiling. Turn the fire down and continue to cook it under low heat for 2-3 hours until the winter melon becomes translucent. (If the water becomes too small, you can add boiling water in moderation.)

4. Filter the winter melon tea with a mesh or gauze. And Put it in the refrigerator.

5. Dilute it with boiled water and ice cube according to your taste when you drink it.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 03:21:47

3826,NicolasName,"Are you aware of the ecological damage from consuming sea life? 

Scientists believe that by 2050, the oceans will have more plastic than fish. 

The average American is responsible for killing over 400 sea animals per year because of their diet. Multiple that by over 300 million, and you have over 100 billion sea animals being killed every year. “Sustainable fisheries” are fed wild-caught fish, and aren’t actually sustainable. 

On top of that, the number 1 cause of plastic in the ocean is fishing gear. 46% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is fishing nets, and 70% of the ocean’s plastic comes from fishing gear, by weight. 

60% of the world’s species have gone extinct over the last 50 years, and the number 1 cause of that is that animal agriculture. 

If you care about the environment, fish has just as many harmful effects as cow body and cow milk, and they typically weigh much less, resulting in more deaths, and there are practically no animal cruelty laws applying to fish, and the ones that exist (for dolphins) are practically never enforced. 

Pigs, eggs, and chickens obviously don’t have a great environmental effect either, but eating sea animals is on the same level with environmental damage as eating cows. Would wish that was more in line with the current discussion.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 03:20:03

3968,NicolasName,"I get it that you’re a communist and corporations/businesses/supply side = immoral and people = good. I just don’t think that’s true. 

My ideology lies closer to Buddhism on this issue, in the sense that I think a lot of suffering is done out of sensuous greed, ill-will, and ignorance, and those are the central things of what we are fighting against. 

I know people who are aware of every single of the industry, liberal, believe the way you do, and they continue supporting the industry because they believe it’s in their personal interest to still consume animals. 70% of the U.S. population thinks that factory farming is wrong, 50% say they couldn’t kill an animal themselves, 50% want to lower their animal intake, yet in the U.S., every year, records for animal consumption are being set and only 2% of the population is vegan and 5% vegetarian. 

The fault isn’t lack of alternatives or corporations, the fault is how people view morality. It’s the same reason people support unnecessary wars and whatnot, we are prone to accepting exploitative violence as a good thing as a society. 

It stems from people’s attitudes that animals are commodities and products, and not thinking, feeling, breathing, living beings. That’s the central issue in my opinion, not that the means of production is not harvesting roadkill instead of cow stomach.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 01:44:26

4004,themostbluecroatoa,"&gt;I know you will argue meat production IS abuse and I accept that position.But I’m referring to a more classic conventional definition of abuse like stabbing, shocking, torturing

All three of these happen in great quantities in slaughterhouses, and much more. Pigs, for instance, have their tails cut off, their balls ripped out, and their teeth clipped shortly after being born, all without anesthesia. And on the other end, the stunning methods before slaughter frequently fail and the pigs are fully conscious when their throats are slit, they're hung upside down to bleed out, and then they're thrown in scalding hot water, where they drown. If this isn't torture, then nothing is.

So rare that no one else has my exact defects to any cardiologist knowledge and research. I’m vegan. I’m told I shouldn’t be because I can’t afford to get really sick and my body doesn’t gain weight the way most people’s do because my heart works 10 times harder to pump blood etc. my whole anatomy inside me was moved around and connected differently just to survive 32 years. It’s a miracle I’m even alive. My parents Are concerned if I keep being vegan I’ll die. So is honey in my circumstances really a horrible thing?

4044,cocktailnapkins,"Most crops are grown specifically for livestock use. False.

The plant-based protein industry wants you to believe that crops like soy, corn and barley are mostly being fed to livestock.  But according to research from United Nations FAO, grain makes up on 13% of global livestock feed. Only 14% of their feed it edible by humans. 86% of their diet consists of things we cannot digest, with 40% coming from agricultural byproduct like sugarcane tops, stover and distillers’ grains that would otherwise go to waste. Pigs and chickens are also monogastrics like humans and cannot digest these products either. However, ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats can safely consume these materials and turn them into nutrient-dense protein for humans. When looking at what only ruminants eat, the numbers are even lower for grain, at only 10% of the diet for cattle, globally. Grass and leaves makes up 57.4% of global ruminant feed ration. The other 46% of non-human edible includes grass and forages. Livestock a crucial “upcyclers”. When examining grazing and mixed systems, however, the study concluded that about 90% of ruminants’ diet comes from roughage like leaves, grass, silage, and crop residues. Through regenerative agriculture practices like rotational grazing.

However, its even different in Australia. With no cattle only being fed on grain. I believe it was between 70-80% that are 100% grass fed and the rest are mainly grass and finished on grain. 

13% grains
1% other edibles
3% other non-edibles

Not even sure it matters since later in this chain you say its wrong to treat the chickens this way, so how is the logic of the meme flawed?

If the level of sentience chicken's posess is enough to grant them moral consideration then why is the meme's logic flawed to compare their living conditions? 

The only way the logic would be flawed is if you were implying that different levels of sentience justify comprably different levels of moral consideration. But you dont seem to argue for this.",1,vegan,2019-10-16 00:41:04

And it’s very difficult to demand for the abolition of slavery when you still own slaves, and thus it is difficult to demand for the abolition of unnecessary violence towards animals when you’re still participating in that violence.

Removing control of production from the bourgeois is so much more effective, is so much **more**, than ceasing consumption of a type of product.  
If you want to have the same amount of effect towards your goal with ceasing consumption, you have to: Beat advertising. Outlast a state bailout in subsidies. You have to effectively provide reasonable alternatives for all the kinds of people who live in and outside food deserts, including the people most vegans don't think about, like people with low ability or energy, people without time, people without money. You have to beat holidays, tradition, culture. You have to care for workers like one would during a strike, except you, the consumer, started it, not them. The bourgeois still controls production, and otherther with the state, it still controls the market.  

With a Strike and workplace occupation, you take away production. The primary counters the bourgeois have to this are: Anti worker propaganda. Keeping unemployment and poverty high (in the World) to fish for scabs. And state violence. It is so much more significant and desperate for them.

The difference between an african american and a polish person is not even remotely comparable to the difference between a human being and a chicken. So no, the same is not true for animals. If that were the case and we took that logic to its ultimate extent, it would be amoral to eat anything at all, because everything strives toward life. 

Yes, I agree that plants do not have the capacity to suffer in the same way that animals do. I am also saying that chickens do not have the capacity to suffer in the same way dogs do, or dogs in the way humans do. This is actually implicit in this part of your own reasoning, it seems to me. 

I'm not making it out to be any sort of utilitarian calculus at all. You prove my point too; yeah, thousands of people in third world countries die without most of us blinking an eye. But guess what? Even more animals die in those places, and that didn't even cross your mind... because human beings value the lives of other human beings more than they do the lives of animals, and the lives of humans relevant to them more than those irrelevant. 

You can have a hard time believing it all you want. I have no reason to lie. Animals would need a conception of death to fear it - some of them do have this conception. Some of the worst days of my life have been when a pig needs to be euthanized for injury, illness, or unaffordable medical expenses. They seem to sense that their end is at hand, even though they saw me every day and trusted me. Maybe they can smell the vet on the property, but it doesn't matter - they obviously realize they're gonna die and are afraid. 

No chicken ever ran from me when it was time to go, though. It's not a detached intellectualization, you're over-anthopromorphizing to an incredible degree. I'm not being absurd; the absurd thing is to try to proport that a chicken's life is equally as valuable as a human beings because... they're just as capable of suffering? Uh, no. That's factually incorrect. They don't have the same capacity to suffer and are obviously not aware of that suffering. It's clear no matter what angle you examine their behavior from. A chicken with a broken foot will still wander around without complaint. A pig, a cow, a horse, or a dog (a particularly intelligent one, to be fair) will come to you for help, or otherwise wait for help to arrive. 

I haven't missed the forest for the trees, friend. I'm looking at the forest, and parts of it are not in very good shape. You're in the pretty part of the forest pretending there's nothing wrong with it. There may indeed be a logically consistent argument for veganism, but I have lost it. Well, no.

It’s just such self-absorbed and assuming approach to the world. As if our judgement on who deserves to live is law. It’s a gross superiority complex. And people will say that we can’t be the judge on life/death or can’t enslave others in MANY other instances but are quiet when it comes to the lives of animals. HOWEVER, I understand (and agree) that as humans we naturally value and fight for human lives over animal lives but I do think that in 2019 we gave the time and resources to exert a bit more effort towards animal lives as well. People are just selective and inconsistent with their morals.

**Your Fallacy:**

&gt;*Laughs in vit. B12 deficiency* **(ie: Vegans cannot get enough b12)**



**Response:**

While it is true that B12 is not produced by plants, it is also not produced by animals. Rather, B12 is the byproduct of a specific bacterial fermentation that thrives in soil, some fermented plant matter, dead flesh and the guts of animals. Fortunately, this bacteria is easily mass-produced for human consumption now, and many foods are fortified with it, so there is no need to eat animals in order to receive sufficient B12.
It is a common misconception that B12 comes from the flesh of animals. However, the truth is far more complex. For instance, ruminant mammals like cows and sheep have stomachs with multiple chambers, and these are excellent growing environments for the bacteria that make B12. Equally important are the grasses these animals eat straight from the soil, which is another primary source of this nutrient. Taken together, the stomachs of ruminant mammals and the soil in the vegetation they eat provide them with the B12 their bodies need. In humans, however, B12 grows in the large intestine, which is located beneath the ileum where it is absorbed. Further, most of us are unwilling to eat unwashed produce, so we do not receive sufficient B12 from the soil. This leaves us with a choice. We can either consume the flesh of dead animals, which contains the B12 the animal has absorbed and is itself another medium for the growth of this bacteria, or we can supplement with B12. Interestingly, factory-farmed animals are regularly fed B12 supplements for various reasons, so it is logical to conclude that we could simply take a B12 supplement as well rather than passing it through the body of a non-human animal first.)

4202,arcadebee,"Thanks for answering genuinely! I really was just curious as it’s very far removed from my own view so I like to hear about it. I’m not sure how it matters if an animal was raised for a different purpose because I don’t believe living beings get their worth from someone else. For example when I had a cat I had a personal bond with her and she was my family, so she meant more to me personally than another cat who I didn’t have a bond with. But that didn’t make her more important objectively, just to me personally. Because both cats are living beings with their own capacity for thought and feeling.

&amp;nbsp;

So if a group of humans has decided “this chicken is to eat” and “this dog is to love” it doesn’t make the chicken suffer any less or make it more deserving of slaughter. I don’t know if I’ve worded that in a way that makes sense. I just think animals have worth beyond what humans assign to them, I don’t think we’re the ones who get to choose something like that for another living being. Another example is when dogs are bred for fighting. I think living being should be able to choose their own worth and purpose, and in the case of animals where this obviously isn’t going to be as sophisticated as human thought, they should at the very least be able to choose not to suffer where possible. Animals bred for food suffer unimaginably, and I don’t think that’s our place to call it their purpose.",1,vegan,2019-10-15 23:48:14

For myself personally I don't necessarily think that non-vegans are ignorant or immoral just that maybe they haven't had the right influence yet. I was an omni for almost 30 years before I made the change. I'm in no place to judge anyone for what they eat. Doesn't mean I won't get angry about it from time to time though. Some people also just don't care about animals. I'd bet there are people here who are vegan and don't really care about the animal cruelty side of it, they're just doing it due to dietary restrictions or because of the health benefits.

**Your Fallacy:**

&gt;More like, lifestyle choices are meaningless without coordinating with other people. **(ie: Going vegan makes no difference)**



**Response:**

It is true that large-scale societal changes rarely happen as a result of one person’s efforts. Rather, these changes happen when a number of people begin to live in alignment with their shared values. In the case of vegans, more people are beginning to live compassionate lives, and each of them is contributing to a more compassionate world. In this way, the animal rights movement is no different from those of women’s suffrage and racial equality, which were both comprised of many individuals who held in common values of compassion, peace and social justice.
On a smaller scale, however, it is important to keep in mind that no matter what another person does, you are accountable to yourself. This means that even though one person alone cannot create the world veganism envisions, you need to be able to look at yourself in the mirror every morning. To that end, it might be helpful to note that each vegan saves roughly 400 animals per year, reduces more greenhouse emissions than non-vegans and uses a fraction of the fresh water resources. Moreover, each vegan chooses not to participate in the market for animal suffering, which makes that market just a little bit smaller and the lives of animals just a little bit better. So while each vegan cannot save the whole world alone, individual vegans are saving a small piece of it, and together those small pieces add up to something great.)

Veganism isn't about the short term, it's a long term ethical stance. We are in it for the long term change that is brought on by continuously refusing to eat animal products. At the end of the day ,that chicken breast is already dead. Her eating chicken in this situation won't change that fact. But her not eating meat over a long period of time, will reduce the amount of chickens farmers will bring into this world to be killed (demand/supply).

Eating meat always made me feel kindof weighted down and dairy always bloated me and gave me poor digestion and I would either be constipated or the whatever you call the opposite.

If for health I would recommend cutting out dairy first  and completely  and cutting out red and processed meats. Chicken isnt overall all that healthy but it's less bad than the others.

First thing you wanna do is pickle chilis, I used Thai Chili's, chop into quarter inch segments and cover in vinegar for at least an hour.

In a mortar add a bunch of mint and work it into a paste. Then add a bunch of cilantro and work it in as well. Then half a bunch of Thai basil and continue. Some sea salt can help with this process. Add some lime juice, a few pickled chilis and olive oil, work it together and then transfer to a bowl. Keep adding oil while whisking to form a thinner texture.

Boil your noodles for a minute or two, they're called vermicelli, bean threads, or mung bean noodles. I got them at a Japanese market along with the herbs and whatnot. Strain and quickly cool with cold water. Get as much water out as you can and transfer to a large bowl.

Toss for a while with the herbs pesto until the noodles turn green, salt if needed, and mix in shaved carrots, sliced cucumber, fresh herbs leaves and whatever else you want.

I put all that into the serving bowl, garnished with some more veggies and herbs, drizzled with a super simple homemade peanut sauce and the chili vinegar.

And also marketing that is done via ""associations"" which is only to make sure certain products have representation in movies, TV, local news, competitions for who makes the best -insert product-, etc etc. This is the primary form of marketing that is done by animal product lobbies because they by intention do not have a very public face. 

What I am saying there is a lot more drive for general consumption than their brand because most companies market on the ~feeling~ the product gives you, so some people recieving the ads will crave their brand of choice instead. For example seeing a coke commercial, but your preferred is Pepsi and you start to think of Pepsi, the commercial sold you feelings, not necessarily coke. 

So while no, they didn't invent meat or the demand, they did however normalize the large amounts of it it via marketing. For example again, the story behind how eggs / bacon were considered normal breakfast food was based off marketing. Just google it, there are a few articles done about the guy who marketed them. He was essentially known as the inventor of public relations so really funnily enough, meat is really married to modern marketing more than almost any other industry.

4543,StickInMyCraw,"\&gt;  I suppose it's possible in some sense to divorce production from emissions, but you're talking about a very specific form of luxury goods, and those goods require an ongoing energy investment that doesn't come for free. Bitcoin uses more electricity than the entirety of Ireland. Games aren't quite as energy intensive as bitcoin, but they are far from free.

Services are not ""a very specific form of luxury goods."" Design/engineering is not either. Software uses electricity, but that's not inherently tied to emissions either (ask yourself if you really believe that slowing climate change means abandoning software development). For many years now growth in advanced economies has been driven by exactly these goods and services. Growth does not equal more physical production of goods using fossil fuels. My point is that the advanced economies today have already disproven the notion that growth can only continue if we use more and more fossil fuels.

\&gt;  Taxation on the other hand, really is basically just a big switch.

Your argument seems to be that carbon taxes could work in policy terms but aren't politically sustainable in the long run. I'm not saying that's wrong (I think there's a decent chance we are basically doomed), I just don't think that it's any less political stable than completely re-orienting our economy in a new and untested way.

&gt;  On this day of July 7, 2012, a prominent international group of cognitive neuroscientists,

gathered at The University of Cambridge to reassess the neurobiological substrates of conscious

&gt; Birds appear to offer, in their behavior, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy a striking case of parallel evolution of consciousness. Evidence of near human-like levels of consciousness has been most dramatically observed in African grey parrots. Mammalian and avian emotional networks and cognitive microcircuitries appear to be far more homologous than previously thought. Moreover, certain species of birds have been found to exhibit neural sleep patterns similar to those of mammals, including REM sleep and, as was demonstrated in zebra finches, neurophysiological patterns, previously thought to require a mammalian neocortex.

Markets and the profit motive don’t create the incentive to poison the environment. In fact, private property is probably one of the most effective tools we have to get people to stop polluting (if you own something you are going to want to keep it in good condition, and this includes land). They can certainly exacerbate the incentive to pollute, but that incentive ultimately comes from basic self-interest and rational individualistic behavior. 

The problem is that it’s impossible to privatize things like air and oceans, so they’re part of the commons which can be polluted. Everyone has an incentive to pollute if it makes them better off, and this is true under any economic system. Why do you seem to think that a centrally planned economy wouldn’t suffer the same fate?

4659,gnipmuffin,"&gt;It's not like omni restaurants are people - they will not slowly convert into vegan restaraunts. They will always profit from selling animal products.

But this is the hope, that in the future, animal products won't be viable commodities for profit.  If the government decided to stop funding subsidies to the animal industry, meat and dairy prices would be so expensive that restaurants surely *wouldn't* be able to turn a profit selling animal products.

&gt;Why not just avoid the omni restaraunt altogether and decrease their profits?

You or Me not going to an omni-restaurant that we already don't frequent is not going to affect their bottom line one iota - vegans are only about 5% of the US population.  Them introducing a new vegan menu/item, and bringing in *new* business because of that menu/item, encourages the restaurant to continue to cater to the vegan demographic (not to mention appealing to omnis that might not otherwise have tried or have access to a vegan meal).  Restaurants only have room in their budget to keep a certain number of items on their menus at a time, if a new vegan dishes knocks off an under-performing meat dish, that is progress.  And the only way to keep that dish on the menu, it to purchase and eat it.",1,vegan,2019-10-15 20:29:03

&gt;In the US, the dairy industry is trying to get plant milks to stop using the word ""milk""

The more vegan options on the menu, the more mainstream veganism becomes and the more likely it is for people to try them. Hopefully that's what we're seeing with vegan burgers and other items at fast food places. Yeah, they make money on meat, but you're not a part of that and maybe you're helping them switch to making more money off of plants.

That's the rationale I have to use because I live in a small town and there are no vegan places here. If there was a vegan place it would make more sense to spend 100% of my money there.

4802,King_Piggums,"I’m personally morally opposed to killing anything period. But the issue of hogs isn’t just that they’re a nuisance or dangerous either. They can and do annihilate entire ecosystems. Much of their diet is comprised of roots and decaying matter so when they eat they’re taking nutrients away from the soil which makes it harder for things to grow, but digging up those roots also makes the soil susceptible to erosion, so when it rains all of the healthy soil is washed away.

Again don’t agree with killing but that is WHY they’re hunted in many places especially the Midwest and Hawaii (hogs left unchecked in Hawaii could easily destroy the entire natural habitat). They completely destroy farmable land and can even do serious damage to forested areas which upsets the natural ecosystem that’s already in place. I grew up in a redneck home as a complete redneck. Most of my world views and diet and such didnt change until the past 10 years when I finally got out on my own. I grew up with my father hunting hogs (he tried to get me to go but I’ve NEVER been able to kill anything. I couldn’t even stomach going fishing as a child) on our land regularly because they would uproot our entire garden (problem because very poor growing up, our garden was about 1/2-2/3 of our food typically) in about an hour overnight and continue to completely destroy everything around us if they weren’t dealt with. They were a threat to our livelihood. 

I love pigs (see username). They’re one of my absolute favorite animals on the planet because they’re just incredible. Extremely intelligent, unbelievably resilient, very very social, they like to be clean, the list goes on and on. They’re truly remarkable animals and I HATE the position that we’ve put them in. There’s no real way to set them free and not completely disrupt the entire natural order because domestic pigs are so far removed from the species that they were domesticated from that theres practically no chance that they’d ever revert to that stage of evolution. The best we could hope for is natural order thinning them out and evolution taking them in a direction where their existence becomes sustainable, but there’s no way of knowing how long that could take or the toll it could take on existing wildlife. It’s a problem that I contemplate at least once a week and I have yet to come up with anything and I hate it.",1,vegan,2019-10-15 19:09:06

I make exceptions with occasional gummy or marshmallow candies, candies with that red stuff made from bugs, or alcohol. Things that I can justify in that they are a bi-product, and the animal is not killed for these products. For me, it's less of a matter of convenience, and just a moral ""where do I draw the line?""

If you go there you can filter by animal rights groups and also by the number of stars (4 stars = lots of transparency and most of the money goes to causes, 1 star= lack of transparency and/or a lot of money is used for administrative/fundraising vs. actual causes).

PETA has 2 stars right now, which is pretty low. There are quite a few animal charities that have the full 4 stars, where over 90% of the money donated goes directly to helping animals or fighting for animal rights. (I saw 125 local, 16 national, and 7 international organizations for animal rights with 4 star ratings).

a lot of these people are in extreme denial.. they don't hate animals, they just won't allow themselves to see truth. they go so long being taught that this is okay, that when reality appears at their front door, they slam it in his face. they feel guilt, and make any excuse that they can to justify why they continue to eat animals. they don't want to be bad people, they don't want to hurt animals. they live in denial, telling themselves it is necessary. telling themselves they're not the problem, finding any way to weasel around the facts when we point out their lies. or just flat out pretend it isn't there. i understand what it is like to be in denial. 

what i don't understand is when people are aware  (or are not) and just don't care. even worse, they want the animals to die. they still refuse to acknowledge facts, but either they put on a harder shell to break or they really are this way. i prefer to think these people are just stubborn, but it can't always be that way i suppose. if you feel no remorse, no denial, i would say that is when you become a bad person. and it is likely there might be other reasons for having that title.",1,vegan,2019-10-15 17:57:33

This is a super complicated topic for me, and I've only taken a few philosophy classes, so thank you for sharing your opinion. 

I agree that this issue could not be solved with anything as simple as, ""lets ban all pet ownership."" 

I own a 45lb lab pit mix that I rescued from the shelter in January. We are similarly bonded and Penelope follows me everywhere. She is always looking to please me, and is the sweetest, happiest dog. I often think about how much I should control her behavior, and wonder if that is even right.

I talk to people at the shelter and they say people come in drunk all the time trying to buy shelter animals for their children, and I think that it isn't right that you can buy an animal in the first place. 

They are bred and sold like commodities. It seems like people like us are just caught in the system and are trying to help these poor creatures that have been controlled by humans for so long.

When I was growing up my grandfather would shoot an unsuspecting sheep in the middle of a field while it was grazing (out of view of the others).

4965,hadmatteratwork,"&gt;Could you define capitalism?

Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are privately owned and production itself is done on a for-profit basis. Capitalism requires growth because it is naturally upwardly distributive. If you had a system of stagnant capitalism, you would eventually find yourself in a situation where the workers can't afford to consume. I suppose it's possible in some sense to divorce production from emissions, but you're talking about a very specific form of luxury goods, and those goods require an ongoing energy investment that doesn't come for free. Bitcoin uses more electricity than the entirety of Ireland. Games aren't quite as energy intensive as bitcoin, but they are far from free. 

The point is to fundamentally change our mode of production. This isn't something you can just turn on and off like a light switch. It's an enormous move that has only been done a handful of times in human history. Taxation on the other hand, really is basically just a big switch. There would be problems, because we're addicted to consumption, and addictions hurt. It's just a matter of reducing the chance of a relapse as much as possible while providing other avenues for fulfillment, which capitalism can't do.",1,vegan,2019-10-15 17:29:39

Yes they're both consuming sentient creatures, but it's not the same ethically speaking. At least, not in an ideal world.... I can 100% agree most farming operations are preformed unethically for the animals, and that can be a fair comparison. And while I'd like to say I shop for ethically farmed meat, I don't have that luxury. I live off of $180 for food a month, and have to shop as cheaply as is possible to do, and for me, who cannot regularly consume beans, rice, soy, corn, potatoes, legumes, wheat, nightshade, brassica, the list goes on, I don't have the options for cheap non meat alternatives all the time without making myself seriously ill (which unfortunately I do often have to do, as it's unreasonable for me to avoid everything that's detrimental in my budget, so instead I have to carefully balance how much detriment I'm willing to withstand before it's too painful to keep doing) and that unfortunately means I have to buy whole chickens at the grocery store to break down at home, or what ever pack of meat that's about to expire and is 50% off, instead of local and fair raised animals. I wish I could, I would love nothing more than to vote with my dollar, but for basic survival I have to stretch my dollar so incredibly far... 
Where exactly does the line of ethics lie, between barely surviving and trying to not starve and become seriously ill, and completely not eating meat what so ever, but at the cost of starvation for two meals out of every three? That's a very real dilemma all too many people face, which is why I'm so strongly about finding a functional middle ground. Unless you're willing to just outright say you want people to starve and get ill for the sake of being absolute on what you consider to be an ethical issue... Just what is it people should do?

5018,ln-cabin," I think it bothered some people because it seems like you're asking permission to not be entirely vegan, asking forgiveness for not checking the ingredients snacks, and for validation that you're still a good person for trying. And now you're asking for validation from vegetarians because vegans didn't give it to you. Yes, it’s better than being full omni from a harm reduction standpoint but your video comes off as self centered. That's not what veganism/vegitarianism is about. It's about the animals and the cruelty that they suffer. I think that’s why it bothers vegans and why you're not getting much traction here.

5037,rumsoakedham,"  **Pumpkin and White Bean Chili**

1 butternut squash

1 sugar pumpkin

1 turnip

1-2 carrots

1-2 parsnips

1-2 stalks celery 

1 white onion

1 head cauliflower 

1 can Navy beans

1 can Cannellini beans

1 can Garbanzo beans

1 can Great Northern beans

1 can Black eyed peas

1 can corn or hominy

½ stick salted butter

2 Vegetarian bouillon cubes 

1 32-ounce carton vegetable stock

5-6 cloves of garlic

1-pint heavy cream

1 16-ounce container sour cream

Crushed red pepper

Salt 

1.  Preheat oven to 350. Carefully slice the pumpkin and butternut squash down the center so you have two halves of each. Scoop out the seeds and set aside for roasting. Take two 9x13 glass casserole dishes and fill with a half inch of water. Place the pumpkin and butternut squash face down in the dishes. Bake for 1 hour. 

2. Peel the turnip, parsnips, and carrots. Chop the turnip, carrots, parsnips, celery, and onion into ½ inch chunks. Sauté the turnip in a little olive oil over a medium-high heat for a few minutes. Add parsnips and carrots and continue to sauté for five more minutes. Add celery and onion and cook for a few more minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.

3.  While the veggies in #2 sauté, prep your cauliflower. Remove the stem/leaves. Chop the cauliflower into rough 1-inch chunks. Place in food processor and grind the chunks into cauliflower rice (or, just buy riced cauliflower). Scoop into frying pan and sauté with a little olive oil over a medium heat until just lightly browned. Set aside with the other veggies.

4. Remove pumpkin and butternut squash from oven. Scoop the soft pumpkin and squash out and place in a bowl. Then, add the butter to it and mash it together until it’s absorbed. 

5. Add all veggies to the crockpot. Add corn (or hominy), and the 5 cans of beans. Add vegetable bouillon cubes and vegetable broth.

6. Mince the garlic cloves and add them to the crockpot. Toss in some salt (start with ½ tablespoon) and crushed red pepper. Turn crockpot on low and cook for 10 hours (or high on 5). Stir it halfway through cooking, if possible.

7. Remove 3-4 cups of the chili and add to a blender. Blend until creamy and smooth. Add this back to the chili and give it another thorough stir. 

8. Turn the slow cooker on warm. Remove two cups of the chili and place into a bowl. Add the heavy cream slowly and stir. Add the sour cream and stir. Add the entire mixture back to the chili and stir. Do a taste test and add more salt, pepper, and whatever other herbs/spices you like. 

Top with: the roasted pumpkin seeds, oyster crackers, cheese (sharp cheddar or pepper jack are the best), chipotle tabasco sauce, and sliced green onions. Serve with sourdough bread and butter for an extra special treat; or kale chips for a healthier treat.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-17 17:52:52

5050,ifonlyihadapenguin,"The reason those things are so prominent in veggie recipes is because they're mostly pretty good alternate protein sources!  Fortunately there's lots of options.

Firstly - and I know this is kind of an annoying suggestion - I would give a few of those items a couple more tries before you write them off.  Some of those things I think are quite sensitive to preparation, and when prepared poorly they taste downright awful.  I'd especially consider tofu and eggplant (good at ""soaking up"" flavours) and beans and lentils (involved in a LOT of different types of cuisine - Indian, Mexican, American Southern, Mediterranean, etc, so lots of options).  

I think though if you already don't like the taste of sweet potato, pumpkin, and avocado you're probably not likely to enjoy them regardless of preparation, since they have a more distinctive taste.

Secondly, there's more stuff available to you for protein.  Depending on your particular restrictions, eggs and cheese could work for you.  Nuts and seeds can also be a good source of fat and protein and they're very calorie dense if you are worried about not getting enough calories.  Chia seeds are my fave, and I like cashews or peanuts in stir fries.

I would also consider TVP (textured vegetable protein), which is a soy protein like tofu but has an entirely different taste and texture.  It needs to be hydrated before it's used; I find mine at bulk stores and use it the same way I would ground meat... I recently made a shepard's pie with it sliced mushrooms and TVP as the meat replacement and it was awesome.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-17 17:17:38

And the quantities are a rip if you order a 'Veggie Delight'. Two triangles of cheese, the thickness of a dime and the size of a potato chip, with 'extra' you get about one honest slice. This is no place to cut corners and save like 8 cents. Lastly, if a Subway doesn't get much traffic, which is normal around here, the stuff just sits out and gets funky.

I also loveee tofu and chickpeas and they can be subbed for chicken in most recipes. pro tip for cooking tofu would be to press it and put it in a tupperware with marinade (i like teriyaki) when you have time. then when you’re ready to eat it, just cook it on a stove top for a few minutes or bake in the oven. the nice thing about tofu and most plant based protein is that it doesn’t have to be cooked through for a certain amount of time like meat, and you can technically eat it uncooked if you want. 
mexican food is another great and easy option. I keep soft corn tortillas, vegetarian refried beans or black beans, vegan shredded cheese, and taco sauce in the house so I can easily make vegan bean quesadillas after work. they literally take less than 5 minutes to prep and cook. just make sure if you buy refried beans that they’re vegetarian. like old el paso has cans that are specially marked vegetarian, and most organic refried beans are safe as well. I recommend amy’s refried black beans and daiya shredded pepper jack for this one but you can use any brands you like.
I definitely noticed a spike in my energy after going vegetarian. It also helped clear my acne in high school sine i was eating less fatty fried foods and more fruits and veggies. the most noticeable benefit was that I hardly ever get sick anymore so I can say it definitely boosted my immune system. also make sure you take a plant-based b12 vitamin supplement, you can find these at walmart. good luck on your meat-free journey! feel free to pm me if you have any questions.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-17 12:55:42

5105,ShrikeFIN,"# Chili sin Carne 

A recipe I've been perfecting over the years. This is basic notes I've made about it, I usually work with what I've got in the fridge, what's in season and what happens to be on sale at the store, ie. cubed sweet potato, whole lot of fresh chilies, lime juice, etc. whatever you like in soups and stews.

&amp;#x200B;

1 can of black beans, rinsed  
1 can of bean mix (or white beans and kidney beans etc.), rinsed  
1 can of tomatoes, crushed (feel free to use fresh only, cubed)  
2 tomatoes  
1 dl soy groats (or more, I often add ½ dl broad bean groats)  
1 green bell pepper  
1 onion, chopped  
2 celery stalks, chopped  
2-4 carrots, cubed  
2 teaspoons of coriander seeds, ground  
1 teaspoon of jeera (ground cumin seeds a.k.a. Cuminum cyminum)  
½ teaspoon of black pepper, ground  
½ teaspoon of green pepper, ground (optional)  
1-2 teaspoons of salt  
2-6 garlic cloves, chopped  
½ dl white balsamic vinegar (to taste) or any sweet vinegar, if using spirit vinegar start with 1/3's amount  
2 tablespoons of brown sugar  
2 dl water  
2 teaspoons of cocoa powder  
1 tablespoon of dried oregano  
1 teaspoon of paprika powder   
½ teaspoon of smoked paprika   
a touch of chili powder (to taste, same goes for fresh chilies)  
1 tablespoon of liquid smoke  
3 tablespoons oil (I use roasted pumpkin seed oil and roasted sesame seed oil, in addition to the oil I used to sauté onions)

Grating some dried shiitake mushroom gives it more richness/fullness (umami). If you have MSG, feel free to use that.

**Method**:

* Add some oil into the bottom of a cast iron pot (or other oven-proof thing) and add paprika and chili powder(s). When the oil has warmed, sauté chopped celery, carrot and onion.
* Add the beans and the tomatoes, bring up to heat.
* Grind your spices, seeds and salt in a mortar, add to pot and mix.
* Add garlic and fresh tomatoes.
* Add the sugars, water, vinegar and whatever else is left, mix well.
* Simmer gently on low heat with lid on for an hour, without lid if it looks watery (in oven at 150C degrees for 2-4 hours with lid on).

Serve as such with oat fraiche and cheese of choice. Or with rice. Or quinoa. Or barley.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-17 11:09:05
5106,BehindTheGeraniums,"In my household, we could compromise because I am just an 'environmental' vegetarian. So with the two of us, we started cooking 50% vegetarian and 50% non-vegetarian meals. This has the same impact on the number of dead animals and on the environment, but is much easier on the logistics. This only works of course if the vegetarian is actually able to eat meat.

From this system, we transitioned to 95% vegetarian within a year. My husband was not super enthusiastic at first, but got used to the vegetarian diet and started to actually prefer it. (I do like to cook by the way, especially Italian and Asian dishes.)",1,vegetarian,2019-10-17 11:01:42

 do you enjoy cheese? perhaps you might have luck with pastas, homemade pizzas, indian paneer curries or quesadillas. 
if not, stir frys are versatile and easy to throw together, but I find that seitan is a nice addition and not as objectionable as tofu.

I’ve been veg for so long I’m not helpful for how to transition away from meat but start somewhere now- tomorrow!

Bonus: no worries about salmonella, and it takes maybe six minutes to cook. And it’s cheap. 


Keep breakfast and lunch vegetarian and literally starting TOMORROW have a veg dinner every other night. That’s super easy- you’re still having meat every 24hrs. After a week of every other night then do meat/fish at dinner every third night. And so on.

I can speak on having a non-veg partner, though. My dad is a big meat eater, so we had a lot of heterogenous meals growing up. My significant other is also not vegetarian, and we cook for each other a lot. Fortunately they don't mind eating meat-free meals (just because you're not vegetarian doesn't mean you need meat with every single meal!) But even if your partner does want meat all the time, most meals can be made to accommodate both diets. Make tacos with beans/beef, make enchiladas with beans and some with chicken, make a stir fry and add in tofu or chicken at the end, let them have meat as a side that you skip. Have a veggie burger while your partner has a regular burger. Make pea soup with ham in their portion. The possibilities are endless!

(She never liked it but was forced to eat it as a child, and then in pregnancy it made her sick like you.) 27 years later, she is in great health and is a tenured professor in biology. You do not need to eat meat to be healthy or smart. You are an adult and you decide what you eat. 

Perhaps it might help to study up on nutrition, so you can show your relatives that you take your health seriously and you \*are\* being smart about your diet. Show them you are getting plenty of protein, iron, and B12. Or, gently remind them it's absolutely none of their business. 

By the way, your relatives' reasoning makes no sense. Elephants and gorillas are very smart, and African Gray Parrots can talk and have intelligence similar to a five year old human (all mostly or entirely herbivores). Meanwhile, owls and cane toads are super dumb (to list just two dumb meat-eating animals). Besides, humans advanced because of the agricultural revolution. Before that, we were simple hunter-gatherers. 

I wonder why your relatives see this as a personal attack on them. Maybe they fear being judged. Just let them know that you are not judging them, but this is your personal choice and you are sticking to it. Don't argue or discuss when they push meat on you, just say no it's not going to happen and try to leave it at that. I would also recommend bringing a healthy side  to family gatherings and ordering yourself something at restaurants. Your supportive S.O. can split it with you.

It also doesn't hurt that my religion involves days and months of fasting that add up to being vegan approximately 60% of the year.

It's not about knowing how to cook, no matter how well you cook, most people are so used to the taste and texture of meat they will miss it and probably think your veggy meal is not as good as one with meat. Just because YOU think vegetarian food tastes better, doesn't mean everyone else will. No matter how well you cook, or how much you ""educate"" them on the subject. You will make more veggy inclined friends if you just cook them veggy meals, share the recipe with enthusiasm and tell them about how different spices can make veggy meals so yummy and just hope they like it, rather than patronize them with your sanctimonious ""education"".

Sure, invite your friends over to try your veggie meals and share the reasons you enjoy it so much with them, but harping on about how vegetarian food is the BEST EVER and how an omnivore just couldn't find any downsides to it at all besides being totally ignorant basically, is not going to win you any friends or new vegetatians.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-16 22:44:49

5299,jehssikkah,"I am also a vegetarian newbie. I don’t eat meat for breakfasts or lunch. I will soon transition to weekday dinner as well, but I agree that it’s hard to make the commitment 100%. My family isn’t supportive, though I know if I pushed, they’d get over it. It is hard for me still because I am lactose intolerant and so many vegetarian options are very dairy-heavy. So I have to go vegan most times, which creates even less options. 

My plan is to premake veggie alternatives ahead of time bc my husband is not vegetarian. He is supportive, and would eat primarily veggie if I made him, but his concern is losing weight. He doesn’t have a huge appetite, so when he eats, he has to eat bulky, calorie-rich, protein-rich foods, or he loses weight quickly. So he relies on meat to get the majority of his calories. 

Anyway, by premaking alternatives for me and freezing them, I can more easily make my own food, while my husband can continue eating what he wants. I’m talking about proportioned meat alternatives or premaking beans or veggie patties/etc.. I’m used to making two versions of dinner though; I did 1200isplenty for over a year, so I often had a “calorie friendly” version of foods. 

I have had vegetarian/vegan friends, and they usually eat a light dinner or bring a snack with them everywhere they go in case there are no options for them. It’s just a compromise they had to make.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-16 19:29:46

And I understand that 100%. My family and friends back home (I’m away at college right now) all eat meat and when I go to visit, they have to rethink about what to make for me now that I don’t eat meat. I think this would be a good opportunity to introduce them to meatless meals - not in an attempt to convert them but just to show them other potential meals. 

I find Italian dishes to be the easiest meal for everyone to enjoy but most people love pasta and pizza! Pasta easily be made into vegetarian and even vegan dishes. You can try to see if your friends are okay with pasta dinners and it’s not that hard to make chicken or eggplant parmigiana if you keep the meat/vegetable separate from the pasta in another platter. 

It is frustrating/upsetting to have to cook separate meals but I think if you two try to cook meals by thinking of the sides first then the main dish, it could be easier to try. 

Example:
Sesame chicken, broccoli &amp; rice
Sesame tofu, broccoli &amp; rice

Only difference is when you two cook the chicken &amp; tofu.

I definitely realize there is going to be a lot of things I won’t be able to indulge in anymore, which is a little nerve wracking. I’ve had most options of food excluding beef for years, and working around a limited diet feels constricting and scary in the preliminary phases of it.

My partner suggested that I am courteous to when we go to friends house for dinner, and that I shouldn’t expect them to make a veg or vegan dinner for me.

I haven’t noticed a real difference yet of me physically or mentally besides for losing some weight due to me eating healthier. Before I wouldn’t really eat salads or vegetables but now I have to to get all the nutrients and vitamins I need.

5318,blueblanket3,"I have been in your shoes and I can empathize. My intolerance wasn’t from pregnancy but  more of a mild intolerance that worsened when I “powered through”. My family and friends were mostly supportive but my SO did have a “who will I eat ribs with now” sulk phase. There were occasions when family members tried to coax me to eat the special meat dishes they had pain-stakingly made because they thought this was  “just a phase” and felt I was missing out. I was able to get my point across my describing in graphic detail how upset my stomach got and how unpleasant I felt. I also armed myself with research showing how gut bacteria can resist reintroduction of foods and cause such violent nausea. 

In an ideal world, people should respect your choice and let you be. But in this case when people see how much harm forcing choices on you is having they will most likely realize their error. It is easier for me as my SO has my back but it was definitely a process. Their resistance might come from a place of love but it is important to convey that your choices are reason-backed and they need to respect and support you for that. I have heard from friends who went vegetarian or vegan for moral reasons that they were also faced with similar opposition.

5369,riwalenn,"I don't have real exact quantities, but here are the ingredients and guidelines :

3/4 servings :

-1/2 butternut squash
- risotto rice (or other rice's to reduce the price)
- warm vegetable broth, around 1L
- A few dried tomatoes or other vegetables to taste
- Spices
- olive oil

Cut you your butternut in half, empty it, and add oil and spices on top of it. I used salt, Peper, cinnamon, paprika and hot pepper.

Put it in the oven, 200°C for 10 to 15 minutes. It will help you to cut and peel your butternut squash.
You can also peel and cut before putting in the oven.

On a big pan, fow heat, add some olive oil, then your rice and butternut cube. Add some of the vegetable broth.

Let it until cook and add more broth when needed. Mix every other minutes.

A few minutes before cooked, add the dried tomatoes 

Once the rice is cooked, you can add some cream/cheese, or plant base substitute if you like. (not mandatory)

If the nuts don’t taste good don’t eat those. Sometimes they are in a store for too long and not stored well so they are more likely to go rancid than a store that sells a large volume of nuts. Keeping them in the fridge is a good idea, they’re fine in a bag for a whole day. 

Next time you buy nuts try to get them from a store that sells a lot of nuts like a health food store or bulk bins at the grocery store. And brazil nuts are great but it’s a good idea to have a variety of nuts since different ones have different nutrients, so maybe get cashews on week, peanuts another week, or make a mix with your favorites",1,vegetarian,2019-10-16 07:05:39

A tofu press works best ([you can get them for under $30US](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tofu+press)), but putting the block between two plates under something heavy works okay, too. Personally, I cook tofu so much that the press was a great value for me.

5435,deaditegal,"Have you ever had a tofurkey before?

I ask because my husband and I use seitan in a LOT of food.  You can make it at home (I bake mine, I find that the boiling method gives it a weird texture), it’s suuuper easy to make and you can season it with whatever you want to give it a more meat leaning flavor (ex: I always add liquid smoke to seitan being used in place of pork).  It tastes VERY similar to tofurkey in terms of that kind of vegetarian alternative aftertaste, but it isn’t a bad flavor by any means, just different.  You can even make it in advance and hold it for a week until you’re ready to use it, or freeze it for even longer.

So far this week I’ve used it for BLTs, Philly cheesesteaks, Mongolian beef and rice and pork fajitas.  Next up I’m making some general tso’s chicken.

Some items I still prefer just basic frozen meat alternatives, like the spicy chicken patties from Morningstar for chicken sandwiches, and the beyond meat burgers and brats for...burgers and brats lol.  Overall though I try not to make the frozen alternatives a major staple in our diet.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-16 01:43:33
5436,Veggiekid69,"Can't go wrong with mushrooms, zucchini, bell peppers and squash and I think the brand is beyond meat, that makes beef tips that are really good. But the best answer would be to ask your friend. It is nice to be able to surprise them, but it's safer to ask.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-16 01:41:45
5437,Veggiekid69,"I love making fajitas with the morning star chicken strips or the steak strips. I season it with Italian herbs and it gives it a nice flavor and I also put soy sauce in the veggies, someone else said it gives it a better flavor than salt and that's so true. And I put a little queso on top and it makes it taste like something from a restaurant. 
The Walmart by me sells pre-made, frozen eggplant lasagna and I make myself sick, because I can't stop eating it. And sometimes I'll buy the uncle bens garden rice and the beyond meat seven grain chicken for a simple, but flavorful lunch. 
And you can't go wrong with homemade hamburger helper, you take any hamburger helper recipe and replace the ground beef with the Morningstar meatless crumbles, soooo good. My boyfriend is a meat loving country boy and he will eat the hamburger helper when I make it. I will also make hashbrown casserole with the morning star bacon and sausage and he loves it. 
2 cans of cream of mushroom
An 8 Oz thing of sour cream
About 2 cups of hashbrowns, more or less for how you like it
2 cups of cheese (I always do more than 2 cups) 
How much ever bacon and sausage  you like, more is better.

5439,Chiisapeake,"Get a cheap oil (a bottle of olive oil here is $4), put a small cut in like 3 garlic cloves (30 cents for several cloves as far as I know) wait for it to cook, add tomato paste (way less than a dollar, should get the resealable kind since you only use a little)

After I stir a can of chickpeas in there and then some water (enough to cover everything), when the water gets hot I add pasta and cover then sit back until the pasta is boiled. Add spices and herbs that you have.

I do it in my rice cooker, super fast + cheap and one of the few foods I actually like.
 Making it around a can of chickpeas and box of pasta, it will last me several days and its high in protein.


Cook lots of pepper in oil and put it on top of pasta with cheese, good. Cook noodles and add some lemon juice and butter with parmesan, good.


Also cilantro lime rice is super cheap and nice tasting. I add chopped onions, avocado, and cheese if I get the chance. Flour tortillas are fun to make.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-16 01:28:28

5449,thejaytouch,"Substitute animal-based broth for veggie broth is like the ""free"" spot on a bingo card. Very easy and virtually unnoticeable. 

Skip the meat in fajitas, burritos, etc. and simply add a thick layer of refried beans. (Or straight black or red beans depending on your tolerance)
Same for chili, just skip the meat (but find a recipe that didn't have meat to start with and balanced the flavors.

Indian food is an easy one too. It's packed with flavors and can easily go with tofu or paneer instead of chicken (or chickpeas, again, if you are not appalled by legumes). Or just veggies like cauliflowers, they have a nice texture.

Side your veggie dishes with grains packed with proteins like quinoa, add nuts just because.

For brunch, try maple or molasse beans instead of meats.

Like someone else said, balance the flavors with a few ingredients of the perfect-meat-free-kitchen. Miso and soy sauce has a deeper taste than plain salt. Same for brown sugar and maple syrup instead of white sugar.

Find a blogger or a chef that cooks in a similar way as you (mine is the Buddhist chef, his first book is the bomb, there are plenty of recipes on his website too).

But as others said, cooking something that usually has meat without meat is often a road to deception. It won't taste the same because it's not the same. It took a little while to get use to it but honestly, I wouldn't go back, I don't miss meat at all. My plates are much more flavorful now. Have fun experimenting!",1,vegetarian,2019-10-16 00:44:29

One of my favorite are tempeh and satay sauce, marinate the tempeh in soy sauce + sesame chili oil + dark vinegar, cook until the marinade starts to caramelize, and add a mixture of satay powder and water in the pan until it's thick and shiny, serve with rice (sticky rice is great with it) and veggies.

5553,Sumnersetting,"I grew up not eating meat on Wednesdays and Fridays. My family has an inside joke about a time my mom tried a recipe for beet burgers and it turned out poorly.

The meatiest veggies are mushrooms, beans, and eggplants. Eggplants I usually stirfry with green bell peppers and make a soy/ginger/hot pepper jelly sauce. Mushrooms and beans lend themselves really well with tacos/taco salad/baked frito pie. Mushrooms are also great with pasta. If you cook them very slowly with garlic and butter, mushrooms will get an almost a really nice, deep flavor. We are a mushroom household. 

I mostly don't really like the ""fake meat"" stuff, but tofu crumbles are pretty great for hamburger in chili. Also, morningstar has frozen fake corndogs. This is not a suitable supper, but they're delicious mainly because pancake.

I've also done stuffed yellow squash with mushrooms instead of any meat. 

Other way to have a filling meatless dish is nuts. I make a parsley pesto that is my favorite dish. I'm not a big basil fan, plus parsley's cheaper, so I'll put parsley, pecans, and garlic in the food processor, and then mix it with olive oil, parmesan, and red pepper flakes. It's great with pasta and peas. It's great on pizza instead of red sauce, personally. 

The last dish I make that I could take or leave meat is Japanese curry using the Golden Curry spice brick. You can find recipes online to make it, since the actual product is just a whole heck of a lot of sodium, which is why it's delicious. It's basically a roux, ketchup, lots of curry powder, ginger/garlic... or you buy this spice blend and dissolve it in water. It works with any veggie combo. I like cauliflower, carrot, potato. Basically, cook the veggies first, then add water/broth, bring to a boil, and add your curry mix.

5600,A_Third_Past_Four,"Look into fake meats if you can. Walmart often carries Quorn and Morningstar brands. With the right seasoning they can be almost indistinguishable from the real thing. I particularly like the ground beef substitute, which I use for tacos and dips. 

I've also used the chikn nuggets and popcorn chikn with a homemade sweet and sour orange sauce, which is really easy and fairly cheap to make and can be eyeballed after a few tries. 

Rough approximation:

Simmer maybe 1/3 cup (serves 3, can adjust while cooking too) pulpy OJ (blood orange juice is even better) with equal part white vinegar. Once some water has cooked off, add equal part soy sauce. Stir often, almost constantly throughout whole process.

Then add 2 spoonfuls of white sugar, one at a time, and use whisk to dissolve. Can add more or use less, to taste. Add a couple shakes each of garlic and onion powder and black pepper to taste, with salt and/or fine red chili flakes optional. Keep simmering for a few minutes, then remove from heat and let thicken.

The more pulp there is, the thicker the sauce will end up.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-15 18:29:27

5641,cottonswabcity,"Hi! Sorry so late. I must admit that I don't have any concrete recipe for this, just used my gut. I made this for myself, and it made just under 2 servings. 

\- 1 package of frozen gnocchi 

\- Handful of spinach

\- .3 kg of girolles (horrible estimate, I know) also, girolles are just fancy chanterelles, according to Google

\- 1/4 to 1/2 white onion

\- 3 - 4 cloves of garlic

\- 1 tablespoon oil

\- \~1 tablespoon butter

\- (optional) 1 tablespoon pesto

1. Cook gnocchi first by heating the butter over medium heat on a regular pan. Once butter is melted, add half of the garlic and let it cook for a little bit to infuse the butter. Add gnocchi and cook on that heat for 3 minutes, covered. Be mindful of the garlic and do not let it burn. Same w/ the gnocchi. 
2. While the gnocchi cooks, add the remaining oil to a pan and let it heat up on medium heat. Add the remaining half of garlic and let it heat up to infuse the oil. Once infused (approx. 1-2 minutes) add the mushrooms and onion. Let it cook down until the onion is soft and translucent, and cook the mushrooms until your liking. For me, this took about 5-6 minutes. 
3. After cooking the gnocchi for 3 minutes, lower the heat to low and cook for an additional 2 minutes. 
4. While the gnocchi cooks for the last two minutes, add the spinach to the veggie pan. Let it cook down.
5. When the spinach cooks down and gnocchi is done, remove from heat and put it in a bowl. Mix in pesto. 

NOTE: I did not mention salt in this recipe. I use salt sparingly when I cook, so just add wherever you think it might be necessary. I'd say a tad for both pans. 

Again, sorry, my recipe writing skills are shit. Let me know if you need any clarification!

5648,nomadicsailorscout,"If she's saying that animals are there to serve us because of the Bible saying we have dominion over the animals, I'd suggest looking at Catholic teaching on the subject as something to share. Even if y'all aren't religious, the arguments used might be handy.
  
From the Catechism of the Catholic Church:
""The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants and inanimate beings, are by nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future humanity. Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be divorced from respect for moral imperatives. Man's dominion over inanimate and other living beings granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of his neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious respect for the integrity of creation.
  
Animals are God's creatures. He surrounds them with his providential care. By their mere existence they bless him and give him glory. Thus men owe them kindness. We should recall the gentleness with which saints like St. Francis of Assisi or St. Philip Neri treated animals.
  
God entrusted animals to the stewardship of those whom he created in his own image. Hence it is legitimate to use animals for food and clothing. They may be domesticated to help man in his work and leisure. Medical and scientific experimentation on animals is a morally acceptable practice if it remains within reasonable limits and contributes to caring for or saving human lives.
  
It is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die needlessly. It is likewise unworthy to spend money on them that should as a priority go to the relief of human misery. One can love animals; one should not direct to them the affection due only to persons.""
  
Here's the link to it: www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm
  
There's also a Catholic social teaching called the universal destination of goods. Basically, it says that we each have an equal right to creation. That ""we"" includes all future people. Because of its impact on climate change, eating meat &amp; dairy (especially frequently), is stealing God's works from future generations.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-15 15:19:56

Most people have this big misconception that if you go vegetarian you will start loosing weight. That’s not how it usually works. Since animal flesh is LOADED with bad cholesterol having a lower LDL cholesterol in your blood stream would be the first measurable/noticeable difference you’ll see about 6+ months into the diet. But if you eat a lot of dairy and eggs your body won’t be able to take advantage of the lowering of LDL. As far as weight, as I said loosing body mass on a vegetarian diet is not the norm. I regularly see people loose a lot of weight on vegan diets but definitely not vegetarian diets. I’ve encountered a few dietitians that are against any plant based diets and are biased. I would recommend you talk with 2 dietitians and not just the 1 you have an appointment with.

5726,ashtree35,"I think it would be helpful for you to try to figure out what the root problem(s) are, and try to think of possible solutions from there.

For example, you mentioned that your class schedule interferes. Does this mean that you don’t have enough time to eat? Or that you can’t eat frequently enough? Maybe you could pack meals that you can eat during class, or try to have a bunch of small snacks/meals throughout the day instead of having three large meals. 

You also mention stress. Does the stress prevent you from preparing food? Maybe you could try buying more convenient/easy foods, or you could try meal prepping once or twice a week so that you don’t have extra stress from needing to prepare foods every day.

You also mentioned that on your previous attempt, you were constantly eating. What types of foods were you eating? Some people feel less satiated on a vegetarian or vegan diet because they are a) eating fewer overall calories than before, b) eating less fat than before, or c) eating less protein than before. Since you said you were constantly eating, you may have been inadvertently been eating lots of low-calorie foods. Maybe you could try eating more calorie-dense foods, like nuts, seeds, grains, potatoes, beans, legumes, tofu, dairy, eggs, etc.

Also, it would be helpful for you to think about how exactly your vegetarian diet differs from what you usually eat. For example, is it completely different, or is it basically the same but with the meat removed? 

It’s hard to offer any concrete advice without knowing the actual reasons for why you are unable to eat more, so these are just examples, but hopefully this is somewhat helpful.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-15 02:13:23

5732,Veg-Out,"While surely unoriginal, I love this recipe because of how easy and cheap it is.

1. Boil a cup of lentils for 20-30 mins until tender

2. Dice about half an onion, set aside a portion for topping your tacos

3. Remove the good parts from the cilantro in the fridge that you let go bad, dice and put aside with onion topping

4. Mince large clove of garlic

5. Once the lentils are done and drained, start sauteing the rest of the diced onion with a few tablespoons olive oil, until tender/translucent

6. Add garlic once onion is about ready, then add about a tablespoon chile powder, a teaspoon cumin, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper (all to taste ofc, but I like a lot of spice)

7. Add in drained lentils and saute for a couple minutes. It should start to look and smell a bit like your typical ground taco meat, but more appetizing.

8. Add a few tablespoons lime juice, extra oil or spices as needed, and you're done!

5739,MotherofHedgehogs,"There are several ways to deal with this.

First, you need to acknowledge to them that yes, you are making a fundamental change in the way you eat, and that is a inconvenience to whoever is the primary cook in your house. They are really not required to bow to your singular wishes, especially a ""new habit"", as much as you wish they would.

Second, do research. How can you help that primary cook with reasonable replacements that do not create additional work for that person, but leaves out the meat for you? I don't know what your family is cooking, so I can't offer suggestions for other meals, so if you provide more info, we can probably help you.

Third, you say that you ""cook when you can"". What are you cooking? Is it any good? Do you have any skill in developing flavor to the point where the meat won't be missed? I once made a Thai noodle dish with all the veg, and nobody knew it was vegan until after it was eaten and loved- it opened eyes for those at the table, because it was delicious. Learn how to use spices, aromatics, and herbs to create interesting food.

Remember that you think that they are being rude to you, but you are also being a bit entitled by demanding that they reform the way that they have lived for this new habit, and it doesn't sound like you are  helping much. You need to be the one doing the heavy lifting here.

Questions you can ask also: ""why is it so important to you that I eat meat?"". You might find that they think you are not getting sufficient nutrition, so be armed with facts here. Maybe this ""new habit"" is something that they don't believe that you will stick to, and maybe you have a history of ""new habits"". I say this as a person that doesn't eat meat, so I think if you can make this habit stick, good on you.

5749,ham_solo,"[Recipe here](https://ohmyveggies.com/baked-pumpkin/). 

Notes:

I only made two pumpkins, but probably used about 3/4 of the listed ingredients. Adjust to fit your pumpkin size. 

 I've made these before and when baking for the first hour, at least one of the pumpkins would crack. I think it's important to put the top very loosely over the pumpkin so some steam can release. Also, DO NOT try to push the stuffing down. That will cause the pumpkin to break. 

These pumpkin skins thickened up and made wonderful bowls for the stuffing. Other pumpkins may not do that. Don't worry about it, they should hold together until you eat.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-15 01:09:44

- interactive customizable meals are a fantastic starting point. So you could do burrito bowls one night and make [lentil walnut taco meat ](https://www.delishknowledge.com/lentil-walnut-vegan-taco-meat/) i use a packet of taco seasoning instead of the dry spices, and cook up some of the Soyrizo from Trader Joe’s, plus some rice, salsa, sautéed onions and bell peppers, avocado, shredded cheese, cilantro, etc. Then everyone can take what they like. Another option would be asian-ish noodle soup bowls, everyone gets a bowl with broth and noodles and then a selection of soft boiled egg, baked marinated tofu, bean sprouts, fresh basil/cilantro, corn, water chestnuts, scallions, etc

I'm filled with an overwhelming dread about the future of... well, everything, and while I realize that pressuring companies and governments and such is important work that I support, it also helps to have something that I personally can control about my own consumption habits. I'm not under the impression that my individual choices matter so much in the long run, but knowing I can look back over the last several months and say 'hey, I've made choices to change my habits based on my values and have been able to stick with those choices' has gone a long way to helping manage eco-anxiety.  


I've gone from meat at every meal (so like, 21 meals a weak would be omni) versus meat a few meals a week (equivalent to only eating meat on the weekends, I think?). I've also been using a lot more plant-based milk and experimenting with new recipes at home, like pan fried tofu, which was a total protein game changer. It helps that I live somewhere with a lot of veggie options and I've slowly been able to expand my tastes and expectations.  


Also part of me whispers about the fact that at some point, my ability to maintain my previous diet just won't exist anymore - either from being priced out of it, or from continuing environmental/economical disaster that messes with supply chains, etc. At some point I/we won't be able to eat so much meat that I've been raised to consume so I might as well get used to that now before my hand is forced.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-14 17:52:43

Despite long term vegetarians’ personal preferences as far as meat substitutes go, I think the availability of more meatless options at restaurants can only be a positive thing, especially since these options are being advertised, and it seems like people may be more likely to try them nowadays. 

I also think people are more likely to try vegetarianism/veganism if they can keep eating similar types of food.

5938,thesheeplookup,"I think the particular instances you cite are good points but not always valid. And to present them as typical or as a broad example is a red herring. 

Sure, if you hunt your own meat, that animal may only have one shitty moment compared to something factory farmed. Of couse that also depends on your method of hunting. Snares are not fast, leg hold traps, also not fast, are you a good shot, or did you miss with your gun or bow and have to track an injured animal before killing it? 

Because it's an unregulated source of meat, we can't buy hunted meat in my country. Not sure if other countries have similar prohibitions on purchase. 

Yes deforesting to grow soybeans from Brazil is bad. But Brazil is also the larest exporter of beef in the world. https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2019/july/brazil-once-again-becomes-the-world-s-largest-beef-exporter/ so not sure that soybeans are the moneymaker or real issue. 

Canada grows tons of lentils. On the praries, where nothing has been deforested. And Canada is the world leader in pulse production and export http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/industry-markets-and-trade/explore-canadian-food-products/canadian-pulses/?id=1426000399901. There are many options aND not all of them inude a deforested Brazil. 

I think your point is that we should eat while creating a smaller ecological footprint. Buy local, grow your own etc - and yes I'm on board with you for that, and concur that the ecological impact may be less if you can pull that off. Keep in mind though that we aren't all veg or reducing our intake of animal products for the same reasons.

There are no natural predators for large animals such as deer or wild boar in Germany at this point, so the only natural regulation would happen by starvation.

That said, there are a number of deer bred in captivity for consumption these days. They do have far better lives than cows, chickens or pigs, but they're still reared in captivity for food. The meat production isn't scalable, though - animals that are kept in such natural conditions cannot be reared in numbers large enough to feed everyone 3 meals a day, 7 days a week.

Evidence of the same pattern is that it's been common that a good veg dish at a family meal gets devoured, and that old tradition of a piece of meat being the highlight of the meal has faded. 

While I'm not vegan, I brought a nut cheese to a friends' place for before dinner snacks. Everyone ate it, no one thought it weird, the guy with the dairy alert appreciated it.

5962,SweetNatureHikes,"I study aquaculture as part of my job, and my organization works closely with fisheries regulators. I used to be basically pescatarian but I've cut out 90% of my fish consumption since starting this job. 

Wild fishing is not sustainable. We are decimating the ocean's fish stocks. In addition, a [huge amount](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2196872-a-third-of-fish-sold-is-mislabelled-heres-how-to-avoid-being-duped/) of fish is mislabeled, making it hard to make informed purchasing decisions. 

Fish farming can potentially help ease the burden on wild stock, but it has risks. Right now most farms are ""open pen"", meaning regular old nets in the ocean that keep fish in. These open pens allow food, pesticides and antibiotics into the environment. They also allow parasites like sea lice in. Every once in a while fish [escape these pens](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/national/canada/2019/9/15/1_4593983.html). *Hopefully* the fish being farmed are native species, but if not they can become an invasive species. They may also interbreed with native fish. 

Steps are being taken to address these problems. Land-based pens are the most straightforward approach, but it's expensive and has its own issues. Aquaculture fish that are unable to breed are available already. Researchers are trying to figure out if run-off food and pesticides are harming the surrounding environment. 

In short, the sustainability of farm-raised depends heavily on the farm. It's a relatively young industry and regulations are still being developed. You might have to do some research on which companies are operating around you and make a decision. In the end, do we need fish this badly?",1,vegetarian,2019-10-14 13:07:21

If I go out to eat, I’ll try to choose something vegetarian but I don’t force it because I feel like I do my part and if a dish sounds good, then why not. 

I’ve also done a lot of research on the topic and while I can see why a majority of people do it for the animals, I just want everyone to remember that there’s people who are suffering at the hands of the industry as well. A lot of migrant workers who are working in terrible conditions with no rights and they get sick from the conditions they work in.

I like the Beyond Burgers that I prepare myself as I enjoy getting creative with toppings at my non-veg family cook-outs and they're really substantial.

I'm not going to bother with fast food places adding faux meat to their menus now as it's just an unhealthy thing I don't need in my life.  It also seems like it's too little/too late sort of thing now too - there's been non-meat alternatives around for nearly the whole time I've been veg and they weren't on their menus during that time, so I already wrote those restaurants off.

I don’t know where you’re starting, but I feel like jumping in without a plan is setting yourself up to fail. Even with the best of intentions, it’s hard to be healthy long-term without that commitment. Cutting your consumption is a great way to start. If you haven’t already, getting rid of processed meats in particular and any highly processed food is a better first step. Focusing on local foods to cut transportation-related greenhouse gasses is also a good step - you can join a local food cooperative or CSA. 

I don’t say that to discourage you, far from it! This was the healthiest and best decision I made. But I did it in stages, and started by cutting consumption as I learned to cook.

I think I liked the boxed one more since it was shredded and de-seeded (and it didn’t have that brine smell!) 

I tried working with fresh jackfruit once and only once. It was very difficult to work with (although I will admit I didn’t really do my research on how to) and ended up being far too much effort for the mole I was making (it tastes ok with tofu so I used that instead!)

6137,mypatronusislove,"Happy (Canadian) Thanksgiving/Joyeux Action de Grâce, Veggit!

Tourtière (ground meat pie) is a traditional holiday food here in Canada, especially among French canadians. It's more typically a Christmas dish, but hey - why relegate it to just one holiday!

True story, when I decided to go veg I made a pro/con list. The only con was ""dad's tourtière"". So, for many years of holidays I've been working on making a vegetarian tourtière worthy of the name. This is the best one yet. 

I don't have exact measurements, I made it up as I went along. But I'm too excited and had to share!

**Vegetarian Mushroom &amp; Tempeh Tourtière**

2 tbsp olive oil

1 onion, diced

4 cloves of garlic, minced/pressed

500 grams (approx.) cremini mushrooms, finely chopped

3 blocks of tempeh, crumbled

1/4 cup tamari

1 potato, grated

1 cup of water (+ more as needed)

2 tbsp white miso

1/2 tsp ground cumin

1/2 tsp ground thyme

Salt &amp; pepper, to taste

Pie crust, top &amp; bottom - *click (here)[https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/8trpmt/homemade_strawberry_rhubarb_pie_with_vanilla_ice/e1cbd6v?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share] for my recipe*

1. Prepare your bottom pie crust in a pie plate.

2. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a wide pot. Once shiny, add the onion and a pinch of salt. Sautée until just softened.

3. Add the garlic and mushrooms. Cook until the mushrooms are golden brown.

4. Add the tempeh and tamari, cooking and tossing for a few minutes.

5. Next, add the potato, water, miso, cumin &amp; thyme. Stir until well combined. Cover pot and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat.

6. Season with salt &amp; pepper. Check for seasoning, and adjust with more tamari, miso, cumin, thyme, salt or pepper as needed.

7. Check for moisture level. You want the mix to be fairy moist, but not with a lot of liquid. Some liquid will cook off as the pie bakes so you want a bit of moisture so that the filling doesn't get dry. 

8. Cool the mixture down, at least to room temperature, before transferring it in to your pie. Top with your top crust, seal the edges and cut some slits into the top to vent the pie. You can leave the pie bare of brush the top with egg wash or milk/cream for better browning (I used cream). Put the pie plate on top of a baking sheet to catch any drips.
 
9. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven, at 425°F for 30 minutes. Then decrease the temperature to 350°F and bake until the filling is steaming and your pie shell is browned all over. Timing will vary A LOT based on how big your pie is, material of your pie plate, your oven, etc. Keep an eye on it. Mine took around an hour.

This looks like a pretty good plan, but check the website [cronometer ](https://cronometer.com) to see if it’s the right amount of calories and nutrition you need. 

For breakfast you might want to add some nuts or peanut butter to make it more filling. As the other option flavored yogurts are usually high in sugar, so if you could swap that for plain greek yogurt and mix in some fresh strawberries or defrosted frozen berries that will be a lower sugar and high protein option. 

At dinner make sure your soup or salad incorporates beans, or tofu, or tempeh, etc to make sure it’s both filling and nutrient dense

I suggest finding replacements for things you already eat, or just making a vegetarian version of what you already like.  For example if you eat spaghetti with meat sauce, leave the meat out or add a veggie alternative instead.  Find a brand of veggie patty you like to replace a hamburger etc...   after that is going okay, then try branching out and find new recipes for new foods.  A word of caution, you will need to be careful about protein and iron intake.  I track everything I eat any way and I’m noticing I’m laking in these areas so I’m finding I have to be deliberate about choosing foods that will give me enough.  Also be careful just about just replacing meat with bread and cheese (this is what I did as a teenager when I went veggie). You will gain weight and feel miserable.

There is also another reason. I spent my teenage years learning country life with farmers. I believe that all life is precious.

We’ve always fed our dog [vegetarian kibble](https://www.pedigree.in/products-detail/1.2-kg/Pedigree-Adult-Vegetarian?utm_source=nails2tail), and a bowl of milk or yogurt in the evening. She does well on it.

So that’s a third option for you to consider. The choice doesn’t have to be *all* meat or *all* plant-based.

As for your other question:

&gt;anyone here who is completely free of animal products in your diet but doesn't call themselves a vegan? If so, why

Yes, many such people here. Veganism is about ending animal exploitation. You can have a strict vegetarian diet (no dairy or eggs) for reasons other than animal welfare (health, environment, culture, etc).",1,vegetarian,2019-10-13 11:50:54

Speak to your doctor for their recommended dose; I had to take 2 a day when my anemia was very bad. 1 a day when my ferritin is mildly low or normal.

As another commenter mentioned, watch what you eat with the supplements. I take mine with vitamin C (either juice, bell pepper slices, or a vitamin C supplement) and a glass of water. Then I don't eat anything for about an hour. Calcium and coffee/tea can worsen the absorption. And make sure you're consistent about taking them daily! In the past I have reached normal ferritin levels, stopped taking my supplements, and my levels obviously dropped again.

6459,joules129,"My go to is mac n cheese and morningstar chicken nuggets (the buffalo wing flavored ones are really good). Also second the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Instant mashed potatoes would probably be a good option with some fake meat. I tend to like field roast frankfurters, or apple and sage sausages. 

Pasta is good. I try to keep some spaghetti and sauce around. Pesto is pretty easy to throw in some pasta if you like that flavor. 

I also like to keep tortillas and shredded cheese around to make some quick wraps with fake meat. My go to fake meat for this would be the morningstar meal starters chik'n strips. You can easily add a sauce like bbq or ranch to these. 

These aren't the most nutritious meals but I know when I don't feel like cooking and eating much the last thing I want is vegetables.

2 c All purpose flour (unbleached is best!)
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt (I do 2 bc I eat way too much salt)
5 tsps butter (I use earth balance)
1/8-1/4c milk or water (I use water sometimes almond milk)
Mix all your dry ingredients together then thow the butter in. Using a fork mash your butter into the dry until it's tiny clumps. Mix in the milk if it seems too dry add a bit more. Basically you want it to form a ball. Not too wet not too dry. This makes about 7-9 biscuits depending on how big you go. Cook at 425 for 10 to 15.

- deep frying oil

When it is done marinating I press it dry between towels. I put my rice in my rice cooker and let that go while I heat the oil and prepare the sauce. The sauce is about a tablespoon grated ginger, teaspoon gochujang, and tablespoon honey. Sometimes I add rice wine vinegar as well. I set that aside while I do the next step. I mix about a teaspoon Tony’s per 1/4 cup of corn starch, (but you should start with less and taste the first tofu slice to make sure it’s not too salty.)

I've been experimenting with different plant milks as I think drinking too much homemade soy milk was bothering my digestive system. Yesterday, I made pea milk, using this recipe (I cooked the peas in the Instant Pot rather than soaking)

It's quite good, but it made too much for my household (I don't have freezer room for more than we can use up in four days) and too much mess/too much stuff to wash.  I'm going to try adapting it to the soy milk maker I already have next. That thing is great, as it's just the one thing to wash and it's pretty much fill it and  go to something else.

Compounds that can decrease the absorption of most veg based irons are tannins (tea, red wine) and calcium (dairy, tofu). And spinach has a high iron but low bio-availability, so it’s not a very good source of iron. 

 Vitamin C increases absorption of iron, so foods like berries, citrus &amp; peppers can help. I would drink lemonade with dinners some nights to help boost mine up. 

Fave veg sources if iron are probably lentils, because you can mix them in with a ton of things (salads, soups, pastas), grains, and oats (so breakfast ish oatmeal’s or adding them to a berry smoothie). Beans are another good source, you can cook some up and add them to salads easily, or have them in soups or burritos or pastas. I hope that helps! Anemia sucks.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-12 16:15:15

Baked beans on toast. 

Use canned soup to cook your rice.

Canned beans and rice with seasonings of your choice. Very easy and fast; basically, the amount of time it takes to cook the rice.

A baked sweet potato is always easy. Just stab it a few times, wrap it in tinfoil, and bake at 220 C (425 F) for 50 min. to an hour. I usually eat it with some kind of prepackaged fake meat like a vegan schnitzel.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-12 15:17:17

6637,napalmtree13,"Check out this recipe from [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/quick-easy-crispy-tofu/) for your first attempt at tofu. You can also do basically the same thing she suggests but use the oven if you have more time and don't want to use oil. It won't be as crispy but it still tastes great.

If you have more time you can press tofu for 15 - 30 minutes and then rehydrate it with something as simple as vegetable stock or a marinade. A tip, though: don't use oil in your marinade. Tofu has a high water content so it's just going to keep it from absorbing your marinade.

[Homemade seitan](https://www.connoisseurusveg.com/how-to-make-seitan/) is tastier to some people than tofu.

Beans and rice are a staple in many countries for a reason. Lentils are also packed with protein and cheap.

Finally, try [TVP](https://www.bulkbarn.ca/en/products/all/textured-vegetable-protein-292). It's a game changer for many people. You should be able to find it in different sizes. I use the smaller, ground-beef-like size for things like chilis and burritos. We use the bigger ones when we're too lazy to make tofu but want protein in an Asian dish.

And not to be gross, but...yeah. Getting more fiber than you're used to can make you really gassy in a sharp and painful way.

If it is a soy allergy, though, there's plenty of great things out there that don't contain soy. Oatmilk tastes better than soy for example and a lot of omnis I know actually drink it too because they like it better than cow milk. Seitan is a good meat replacement if you can't have tofu and it's pretty easy to make at home.

Personal choices, by definition, only affect the individual making the choice. With eating animal products, there are other sentient beings involved. It is not a personal choice to harm animals for trivial and unnecessary pleasures. Our personal choice ends where someone else’s choices begin.

only females are required because males don't lay eggs. As such, in the breeding process, the males and females are divided when they hatch, and the males are killed immediately as they serve no purpose. Subsequently, their sisters go on to be kept in captivity until their egg production is no longer profitable to the farmer, at which point they have their throats slit. This is generally at around one or two years old. **The average lifespan of a chicken is eight years.**

 The very definition of grass-fed/organic/free-range animals is actually very loose and can vary wildly.

 - a few dried bay leaves
 - a few dried thyme branches
 - soem olive oil
 - 200 mL of soy and oat milk
 - some grated emmental

I peeled the potatoes and cooked them in water until they were mushy enough to be made into mashed potatoes. I mashed them, added the vegetable milk, a big spoon of olive oil, some pepper and some salt. 

Meanwhile, I boiled the lentils in water until they were really well cooked and mushy. 

In a wok, I fried the sliced onions and carrots in some olive oil for a few minutes, then added a glass of water, the garlic, bay leaves and thyme. I'd suggest slicing the carrots very thinly to make them cook faster. I covered the wok and let it cook for 15-20 minutes (or until the carrots were cooked). I then added the tomato pulp, shredded the spinach leaf in, and soon after added the lentils (because they were already well cooked, I didn't need to let them cook longer). At one point I removed the bay leaves and the thym.

In an oven thing (don't know how to say), I spread the lentils/carrots/tomato in a nice even layer, then the mashed potatoes, and finaly I added some grated emmental on top. I put it in the oven, 200°C, for 15 minutes (everything was already cooked so it was more to re-heat the potatoes and melt the cheese).

It's excellent :)",1,vegetarian,2019-10-11 18:25:25

Ingredients


1.5 litres Vegetable oil

100g Gram flour

1 Manly fist size Potatoe

2 medium Onions

1 fat Red chilli

10 big sprigs of Corriander

4 birds eye chilli

1 heaped teaspoon of chilli powder

1 level teaspoon salt (i know it sounds a lot but it is correct amount)

1 teaspoon of cumin

2 teaspoons of Corriander seeds

125ml of water or as much as needed

1 level teaspoon of baking powder (this is essential)

Love





Get a big ass pan and empty out oil. The pam should only be 1/3 full. So you will need a big pan, heat oil on a low heat for roughly 15 mins. 



Whilst oil is heating (only if you are quick at chopping, if not, wait to heat oil after batter is ready) 


Get a largish glass bowl, peel onions chop into tiny cubes, then finely chop corriander both types of chilli. Add to bowl and stir, then add salt, chilli powder, cumin amd corriander seeds. Stir all together well. 

Peel potatoe amd chop into tiny cubes, add to bowl, stir, add half of water , stir, gradually add the gram flour amd stir. Repeat proocess until the potatoe and onions are fully covered in a thick layer of batter. You will know it is the right consistency when the batter takes its sweet time falling off a teaspoon. Once it is at this consistancy and the oil is hot and you are ready to fry, add baking powder and stir in thoroughly. 


This is the tricky bit.

You will need 2 teaspoons. 


Take bowl with batter over to cooker, place bowl next to the pan with oil, see if oil is hot, get a teaspoon with batter into pan as close as you can, using other teaspoom gently tease batter off and into oil, repeat until pan is full. 


Normally the batter sinks to the bottom but after about 30 seconds it should automatically rise up. If doesn't tease amd stir with frying spoon. Once the Pakoras have floated to the top, increase heat to medium, stir every 30ish seconds. Once they have turned to the cplour of mine. Remove from frying into a plate with kitchen roll.

6875,A_Third_Past_Four,"This is as good a place as any for me to share my story, and is often what I tell those who pry. I usually start with ""I do not eat an animal"", which is usually seen as phrased weirdly enough to not warrant follow-up. Sometimes, though, people are nosy. Be warned there are a couple graphic parts

A few years ago, I went fishing. Didn't catch anything. That night my kid, who must've gotten a cold at school, crawled in bed with me and got me sick as well while I slept. I had a dream that while fishing, I was inspecting the hook and accidentally inhaled it, getting it lodged into my throat. I ran around frantically for hours (in my dream i experienced every second of those hours) attempting to beg for help. As I couldn't talk and was freaking out, no one knew what I wanted. 

That dream was the kick in the ass I needed to start thinking critically about what animals go through to be eaten.

I still, for reasons unknown to me, ate meat. Until the end of 2017/beginning of 18.

I had a couple pet bunnies, and had heard that someone local sold bunnies for consumption. I wasn't going to get one, but it sparked my general subconscious curiosity. That night, another dream.

I had gotten 3 bunnies, already processed. I took one, microwaved it to cook the meat (wtf brain) and fried to crisp the skin (wtf brain). I sat on my couch, across the room from my irl bunnies, and started to pick at my ""meal"". Then I saw its blue eye twitch. I did a double take, and it was still again so I thought, ""I just imagined it. I'm feeling guilty at eating a bunny in front of my bunnies"" and kept going. Then the eye moved again, and made eye contact with me. The poor thing was still alive. I freaked out, cleaned her up, and put her in the hutch with my young doe. She promptly made herself at home, and suddenly had all her fur back and apparently recovered, although she still had a wounded and charred and flaky spot in the crook of her hip where I had eaten her. Wtf brain.

When I woke up, I stopped eating animals that could move their eyes. A few days later, all mammals. A few days later, I cooked a duck and have not eaten an animal since.

It wasn't difficult to the degree or in the ways I thought it would be. It was a pretty seamless transition and I don't really have any problem avoiding meat. Sometimes, though, some will smell appealing for a few seconds. I know I'm likely to reintroduce it once the lab-grown stuff is sorted out and accessible. 

Sometimes I feel not valid due to my unorthodox way of becoming vegetarian, but I hope my actions count for more than me trying to avoid guilt. A lá Paarthurnax. Please don't kill me 😟",1,vegetarian,2019-10-11 17:27:56

To cook it, I mix it with some marinade that's made for meat, or seafood, it just depends on your taste. The one I use a citrus herb marinade, but there are lots of different flavours you can try. Then I just put it into the frying pan and cook it until both sides are crispy.

Tomato soup and cheese on toast, or hummus on toast, or just toast.  Pasta and a jarred sauce, maybe with meatless meatballs.  Scrambled eggs with a veg tossed in are another big one for me.  Or finger foods, like cheese and crackers or veggies and dip, especially if your budget will stretch to getting things that are pre-cut.  Also if you are having a hard time going to the grocery store are you in an area where you can get groceries delivered?  Having an extra step removed can make a huge difference.

As for the eating itself, ymmv of course but when I truly don't have an appetite and have to force myself to eat I pick a book or a show or something and only let myself read/watch it while I'm eating.  It's both a bribe and a distraction from the actual act of consuming food.  Or, with the finger foods mentioned above, if I can't make myself sit down for a whole meal I can at least grab a few crackers, or a container of yogurt, and trick myself into the idea that ""snacking"" isn't the same as ""eating.""

Lightlife were much less moist and meaty - they were a little dry and reminded me more of soy-based stuff in texture. For reference I cook both types on the propane BBQ. Maybe you got a bad pack?

A recipe book tipped me over though. It provided 10-12 go to recipes that I could do in my sleep, so I never ran out of meal ideas.

I know bipolar will probably throw you off your idealism once or twice, but if you ""fail"" you can just start again. We all had slip ups. I'm not proud of it, but I just continued making my next meal vegetarian, and then put in a little more effort. This could be applied to episodes as well.

As far as snacks go though: there are veggie chips, I like the company tetra, they make like 15 flavors and I really like the cassava chips they do.

You can also make avacado toast, which is super universal, toast, avacado, and then whatever the hell you want on top of that (some salsa is bomb). You could make buffalo cauliflower and reheat little portions at once to snack on. Hummus is a big one if you like it, you can use chips, crackers or just straight raw veggies. There are a few companies that make tofu dips that are SURPRISINGLY good, and you can dip just like hummus.

6998,luminousshadows,"For sure! One benefit of vegetables like mushrooms and broccoli is that you can eat a lot more in volume compared to meats while still retaining a lower level of calories. The trick is finding the seasoning and cooking that makes it great for you. Personally I like getting some color on my veggies so they have some texture, using things like nutritional yeast (tastes way better than it sounds), five spice, paprika, onion, garlic really ramp up your dish. So find your bases, rice, eggs, pasta (maybe not pasta if you intend to lose weight, though there are veggie pastas), and you can take it wherever you want with what you want! You can also make a lot of delicious veggie sandwiches and wraps, wraps are better for calorie mindfulness. Indian food is hard for some people to get into but I think there is an Indian dish for everyone out there, they arent all spicy or out of your comfort zones. You dont *have* to use ""alt"" proteins, but you have options like tofu, seitan, tempeh and a few others. All of these are fairly bland to begin with, but their entire purpose is to saturate what you cook them with, and to be made into the texture that you wish for. 

It is likely going to take you some trial and error, but its definately worth it! If you ever dont feel like cooking, places like taco bell are adopting a bunch of vegetarian offers, like the beyond cali burrito (fucking tasty).",1,vegetarian,2019-10-11 09:47:38

It probably doesn’t help my stress coping mechanism is eating and to try to keep myself away from junk food I snack on a little cheese to distract myself. I buy cashew cheese when I can. There’s a place in the next town over with AMAZING cashew nacho cheese they make in house, they sell it separately or put it on incredible jackfruit nachos. Besides that, accessibility can be difficult where I’m at. There’s a Whole Foods 45 minutes away that carries some but lord knows it’s expensive.

Butternut Squash Soup:

2 Butternut Squash, peeled and cubed.

4 Sprigs of Rosemary

A Lot of minced garlic

2 small onions

3 stalks of celery

1 small box heavy cream

4 cups vegetable broth

Kosher salt, pepper, french thyme (any would work, I’m sure), onion powder, garlic powder (trust me), kosher salt, fresh cracked black pepper.




Peel, deseed, and cube your butternut squash. Cut up your onions and celery. throw it all on a sheet pan, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and make sure it’s nicely coated. Salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Put the rosemary sprigs on top, whole.

Roast at 400 in the oven for an hour. Remove, and put it into the vegetable broth and lightly heat it in the brother until the broth is more orange in color. Add the minced garlic, french thyme, and more salt and pepper if you need. When properly heated, use an emulsion blender (or regular blender) first on low, then high, and slowly add the container of heavy cream as you blend it. Finish heating and give one last taste for seasoning. 



For the parmesan crisps, it’s easy.... Put real parmesan in a nonstick pan, or with a little butter or oil, until it crisps. Gently remove to cool so it forms up. I put a little kosher salt on it as it melted, too.

Pigs. PETA estimates that 121 million pigs are killed for food in the U.S. every year. Piglets are separated from their mothers as young as 10 days old. Mother pigs, called sows, give birth without rest of space to turn their bodies around for up to four years before they’re slaughtered. Piglets are moved to pens where they grow to about 100 pounds. Farmers then move the piglets, called feeder pigs, to corn farming states like Illinois and Indiana, where pigs reach market weight (about 300 pounds). In the back of crowded trucks on the way to slaughter, up to 1 million pigs die every year.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-10 20:32:25

Physically feeling better may mean more energy which means you move more and get better sleep. And maybe you don’t get colds as often. If that’s the case, you may be feeling better because you are giving your body nutrient rich foods and your body needs nutrients to function. Your car runs better when it’s all oiled up with a full tank of gas. A salad is a full tank of gas whereas a Taco Bell burrito is like putting $5 worth of gas in the tank. 

Feeling better emotionally may be for several different reasons. You may feel better emotionally because being responsible feels good.

7387,ree_san,"My kids have autism and arfid. They can eat carrot, it’s crunchy and sweet so if you can eat apple slices then carrot is a good one to work on next. Carrots are also cheap and keep well in the fridge so they are a good one to work on next.

My kids are working on peas and corn right now. They are both sweet and very cheap to buy frozen. They are already cooked so you only need to defrost them. You can do this in the microwave but I keep it even simpler and just put them frozen into a container in the fridge in the morning (or night before) and they’re defrosted by dinner time. My kids do 10 kernels corn and 10 peas a day, you don’t have to eat a tonne of them to start getting desensitised! 

If you can get used to peas, it’ll be great for you as they’re quite high protein for a vegetable. Where I live you can also buy plain white pasta fortified with oats to increase the fibre and protein, cheaply. I’d encourage you to find something similar and if you’re happy to spend a bit more, try the pulse pastas (made with lentils, chickpeas etc). 

My kids are also working on cashews, they are a mild and crunchy nut and should be pretty doable for you based on what you already eat. A good goal to start would be 10 a day, keep them in the fridge cos if you buy a large bag they’ll last ages.

Do you eat dried fruit? Dried apricot is a good iron source, if you can get that going and the cashews I’ve got a great bliss ball recipe that has apricots, cashews and hemp seeds which is very nutritious.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-10 02:02:22

There's nothing shameful about having these cravings. It's not harmful in any way, it's not trying to be offensive either. I think people should be allowed to express it.

I disagree with not allowing references to eating meat in general ; it's not easy to transition and it doesn't matter whether we like it or not, liking the taste of meat isn't something that can easily change and it needs to be discussed when it comes to transitioning to vegetarianism or staying vegetarian.

Otherwise: Tofu cut into cubes, covered in cornstarch and Goya complete seasoning, and left in the oven to dry out are taste and texture identical to pieces of chicken. Tempeh's only texture is crunchy. Thin slices with any 'bacon' marinade off the internet taste great. Fruit smoothies wiht protein are great. if he complains just drown that shit in simple syrup until it taste like a 7-11 slurpee. At least marginally healthier. And most important last step?

7524,6894,"I went vegetarian solely for environmental reasons.

1. Meat has been linked to cancer and heart disease. 

2. Proper diet planning isn't hard. Get a cronometer account and mess around putting different food in etc. That's how I figured out what I need to eat in a day to get what I need. 
The *only* nutrient you can't get from plants is vitamin B12. Supplements are cheap and many foods meat for vegetarians are fortified with it. 

3. Absolutely. Dropping meat, or even better all animal products is one of the largest things you can do on an individual basis. Dropping animal products reduces your carbon foot print by a bit over a ton a year. You are also saving thousands of gallons of water a day, reducing land usage. You won't be contributing to manure runoff that's poisoning our water with toxic algae blooms etc.

This [chart](https://i.redd.it/cedus2bg77n21.png) gives a good rundown of the environmental impact of various food products.

It is true that it can be more challenging to get the nutrients you need as a vegetarian. Non-heme iron, for instance, is a lot more finicky in how it's absorbed than heme iron. However, simply not eliminating eggs and dairy from your diet can help you go a long way toward fixing nutrient deficiency issues. 

Any endeavor as central to life as eating, that you can't share with your spouse, is going to be very difficult. Rather than you quitting meat cold turkey (pardon the pun) I would suggest that you start by the two of you looking at ways you can reduce meat consumption together. In terms of the environment, even dropping red meat alone is a huge benefit to the world. If you can scale back your red meat consumption to once a week for a few months, together, I feel like that's a sustainable thing. When you have successfully done that for a time, expand it to be never red meat, and never pork. Eventually, bit by bit, you can work your way up together to chicken only, or fish only, maybe, and then maybe you can be altogether vegetarian.

7533,6894,"*Textured* vegetable protein is just defated soy flour. Has a similar amino acid profile as tofu but with less fat. Re-hydrate it in mock meat broth to improve the flavor.

In my opinion TVP is best used where the meat it's replacing is loose. Like in pasta sauce or a pot/shepherds pie. It also makes a pretty good chili. Lentils can also be used the same way.

 Nutritional yeast is mostly used for flavor and B vitamins, you would have to eat way too much to get an appreciable amount of protein. Its flavor is similar to cheese.

While mushrooms are indeed very high quality protein, they are not protein dense. Concentrated fungus protein, like quorn products, are indeed great sources of high quality protein. 

I'm personally a bit fan of Seitan. It's wheat gluten, just wheat gluten. Very high in protein and has a texture reminiscent of processed chicken products. Think chicken nuggets. [You can make it from flour for really cheap.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYubcYQvFKY)

Also, by your logic, if it feels pain, you shouldn’t eat it.

Ethically, killing a cow and killing a chicken is the same. Both are sentient. Neither wanted to die.

[Here is a post I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBased4ThePlanet/comments/dda4fo/evidence_resources_and_more/) linking several studies about the impact of animal agriculture. The first study is one of the most comprehensive ever done on the food system. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/6QrQxXJ.png) is the graph from it showing the relative GHG emissions, land use, and water use of foods.

I also post a lot to my subreddit, /r/PlantBased4ThePlanet.

[Protein combining is a myth.](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-protein-combining-myth/) If you are worried about it, make an account at [Cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com/) and check out your diet for yourself. It's basically impossible to be protein deficient if you eat enough calories and don't get them all from a single food.

The only supplement you *need* on a plant-based diet is vitamin B12, which is commonly fortified into milks, cereals, and nutritional yeast. That said, a supplement is so cheap and lasts so long that I always recommend it. [Vegetarians are also at risk for deficiency,](https://nutritionfacts.org/questions/what-is-the-best-way-to-get-b12/) and even meat eaters aren't necessarily safe.

\-Roasted sweet potato. Thoroughly wash and dry them whole. Poke with a fork like 6-8 times. Rub down with a little oil. Put on a lined sheet tray. Bake on 400 degrees for 45 minutes-1 hour or until they start oozing sugar syrup.

\-Steamed chayote. The most plain vegetable in the universe. Slice or cube (peeling is optional) and steam for 5-7 minutes. Can literally be flavored with anything since it's so plain.  Salt and butter are just fine.  I also like sprinkling it with poultry seasoning. Also an amazing vegetable to lose in a soup or chili.

\-Roasted vegetables.  Start out heavy on the potatoes and carrots and slowly add some more things to the mix. Cube up everything the same size.  Toss with a tablespoon or two of oil and your favorite seasoning (garlic powder, rosemary and parsley are all classics) and roast at 400 degrees until everything is tender.  Suggested things to try in the mix: parsnips (look just like white carrots and have a similar but stronger flavor), beets (the golden ones won't turn your whole mix magenta!), rutabaga (sweet and nutty) or butternut squash (not too far off from the flavor of carrot/potato.)

\-Learn how to make cheese sauce. You could coat a sock in cheese sauce and it'd still be palatable. (Note: I'd probably try some steamed or roasted cauliflower or broccoli rather than an actual sock.) Melt 2 tbsp of butter in a pan. Add 2 tbsp of flour and stir until the flour is coated in butter. Slowly whisk in a cup of milk. Bring to a simmer and add 1-2 cups of your favorite melty cheese. This also works great with macaroni.

\-Try ordering veggies from your favorite restaurant. My students would never eat broccoli unless it was drowned in garlic sauce from the Chinese restaurant!",1,vegetarian,2019-10-09 14:12:39

fondue with whole grain bread, 

racclette with potatos,

whole grain pasta with alfredo or primavera sauce

Eggplant parm or veggie lasagna with a side of whole grain pasta, rice, quinoa, or potatoes

whole grain tortilla quesadillas with avocado, sour cream, olives and home made pico de gallo and beans

Various creamy Indian dishes: palak paneer or Malai kofta or navratan korma with whole grain rice and whole grain flat bread

lentil soup topped with olive oil, shredded cheese, and served with bread

Mushroom risotto. Don't skimp on the butter and cheese

PB&amp;J on whole wheat

Noodles with a satay sauce, veggies and fried tofu cubes. If you need lots of protein you can use those bean noodles for this.

I'd definitely get those blood tests to make sure you're not missing out on something, but if not I'd try to get excited about food again...read some cookbooks, watch some shows, try incorporating more mockmeats since that's comforting for you. 

Know that abstaining from animal products is a powerful thing to do with real world results (the fewer chickens that are cooked to eat, the less demand there is for chicken-farming, fewer chickens raised in captivity in future). You are doing a wonderful thing and should be proud of yourself! 1.5 years is many lives saved!

That being said, if you do decide that you're going to eat meat again, remember that it doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. Eating meat one day a week is still wildly better for the animals and the planet than eating meat every day.

7773,octopuscat77,"While sugar is the most easily used, starches and fats are broken down into usable energy relatively easily. Unsaturated fats require extra work compared to saturated fats because they generally need to be saturated before they can be used. Proteins take even more work to get broken down into usable energy.

In crude terms, sugar is a 6 carbon molecule. To use it as energy, it is split in half into a 3 carbon molecule and then individual carbons are split off for energy. Starches are sugars stuck together in long chains. They get split into 6 carbons sugars and then processed as sugar. Fats are similar to long zig zaggy chains of the 3 carbon pieces. Saturated fats have all the carbons and hydrogens in place. Unsaturated fats are missing some hydrogens. When you see hydrogenated things in an ingredient list, they have added more hydrogens to the fats in it, but that often creates trans fats so you don't see that much anymore. Proteins are made of amino acids (and other things) which aren't built up cleanly out of those 3 carbon blocks of energy. To dig more into it, I recommend looking into the citric acid cycle.

7853,another-megan,"Okay! 

Would totally recommend putting veggies in a juicer. You can get so many good nutrients and cover up the taste by mixing with a blend of other flavors. Downside: It gets expensive!

Definitely start eating veggies with a ton of seasonings you like; garlic/ onion powder, pepper, ranch dressing, etc. Would stay away from the salt unless you decide you like the flavor of the veggies because salt brings out flavors naturally.

Would also recommend pastas like spinach, tomato, carrot infused pastas to add more veggies. (I love black bean pasta, but might not be for you.) 

Also, if you currently do quesadillas, change your wrap from white to veggie wrap!

My ""avoiding unhealthy foods"" is to try and mainly eat at home, eat until I'm 80% full, don't go all in on starches or fatty foods, don't fry things, dessert is not a daily thing. Breakfast is an egg and toast. Dinner is like a salad, or a tomato sandwich, or roasted veggies, or a stir fry, or fried rice, or pasta with lots of veggies. Lunch is leftover dinner or a green smoothie and fruit.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-08 19:51:29

7928,octopuscat77,"Your body's cravings are based on a lot of things but your metabolism and your gut flora are really important to it. The gut bacteria you have actually can signal to your nervous system by releasing chemicals. Eating different things leads to different types of gut bacteria. Plants are actually full of things that kill of lots of microbes and so can end up cultivating gut flora that really wants broccoli etc. instead of chicken wings or high fructose corn syrup.

Metabolism is also important to it. The body burns different types of fuel at different times. If you have sugar, it hits your blood stream immediately. If you have saturated fats, it tends to hit almost as fast. If you have unsaturated fats, the bodily will wait til it has burned through easier sources. Meats are generally high in saturated fats. Fruits are generally high in sugars. Vegetables and nuts are generally relatively higher in unsaturated fats. Replacing meat with fruit and veggies is going to make you want more of those energy sources compared to meat because your body will have adjusted it's pattern of how it burns calories.

Also there's just the whole thing of being conditioned to things that you like eating and make you feel good.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-08 19:40:29

Sounds like you need to maybe instead figure out the right portions/calories that are best for you compared to how active you are. When I switched my diet a year and half ago I lost 2 waist sizes fairly quick. I'm already a skinny guy and was scared to weigh myself, however much to my surprise I weighed almost exactly the same weight, yet still lost 2 waist sizes.. I was baffled, but that is when I decided to never go back to my old diet.

Also maybe don't look at it as an all or nothing thing. That's what I did when I switched to vegetarian..or should I say ""mixatarian"" about year and half ago.  


I'd say 90% of my diet is vegetarian, I never buy meat personally to cook at home, but if I do ever decide to indulge it is normally lean such as fish, turkey, or chicken.

7949,ermahgerdafancyword,"Hej there. So, I feel that you didn't get much constructive advice so far and just wanted to tell you that you're not alone. I'm in the same boat.

Been at it for over ten years now and never lost the craving for it, like so many others described. I have found two things to be most helpful: 1. Find a diet that satisfies you. Like, something that makes you feel stuffed and completely sated, like meat used to do. For me, the trick was the right carbs. Whole wheat pasta, potatoes with the skin, bread that's mostly seeds and oats (if you're interested in a recipe, you're welcome to contact me) ect. are really filling (fibre!) without taking up too many calories. Find what works for you, so you're not hungry anymore. That's your worst enemy here. 2. Surround yourself with like-minded people and ideally cook with them. To a certain degree it's out of sight out of mind, so if you're always watching others have what you want, the craving will never leave. Eat with other vegans/vegetarians. For me, regularly cooking with them, having them be enthusiastic about your food, giving you new things to try really helped with the mindset. Something clicked, and eating became less about forgoing what I really wanted and more about being excited what was there. 

What you are doing is very objectively right and a good thing to do. Not being perfect doesn't diminish the very real impact you're having evey day you consciously decide to do it. Keep at it!",1,vegetarian,2019-10-08 17:58:26

7982,TeKerrek,"* 1 can black beans

^ Give these a light mashing with a fork, but leave plenty of big chunks

___

* 1/4 to 1/2 of an onion  
* 1/4 to 1/2 of a bell pepper  
* 1 to 3 cloves of garlic  

^ Amounts depend on the size of your veggies and the veggie-to-bean ratio your prefer. These three things can be diced as coarse or as fine as you prefer, but the finer the easier the burger will stay together. I actually throw them in a food processor for a bit to get them very fine, although this tends to produce too much liquid.

___

* 1 egg  
* dash of worcestershire sauce (obviously the real stuff contains fish, so substitute or leave out as you see fit)   
* dash of salt, pepper, chili flakes  
* 2 tsp. cumin  
* bread crumbs - enough to hold everything together and lightly coat outside of burger - approx. 1/2 cup

___

Lightly mash beans. Mix in most of the veggies, leaving some out so that you can adjust the moisture content later if necessary (if you used a food processor, leave out most of the liquid). Mix in the egg and seasonings. Add bread crumbs and mix thoroughly. Continue adding bread crumbs until your near your desired consistency.

**Key tip**: The mixture should be very wet and sticky. This is good, as it keeps the burgers from falling apart, but makes them a pain in the ass to handle and work with. Instead of continuously adding bread crumbs until your burgers don't stick to your hands (this will likely cause them to fall apart) simply form your mixture into balls, and roll them in bread crumbs. (Kind of like you would give a ball of dough a coating of flour to keep it from sticking.) This will make the outside dry and easy to handle while keeping the inside from getting too dry. Smash the balls down in to patty-shape and apply more bread crumbs to the outside.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-08 15:31:49

The new products that have been coming out have really eased his cravings. Its made sticking with it a lot easier for him.

When I first stopped eating meat, I still craved the taste but thinking about eating it made me want to vomit after I watched some documentaries and did some research. In my experience, the want kind of just goes away when you don't have it for a long time, like eating sugar or drinking soda. 

My main suggestion would be to branch out your food choices. Weve tried a lot of new cultural dishes because they're veg. Repetition kills motivation, ya know?

8195,a_marie_z,"Do you have kids who are old enough to help with chopping, or another adult in your household? My husband and I usually chop in parallel, so it takes half the time. My parents do this too - my mom hates chopping, but my dad is really good at it. You will also get better/faster with practice!

You can definitely use the small food processor for thin slices of carrots, onions, and other similar veggies, or for shredding carrots or zucchini or beets. I agree that the shapes you chop are generally less important - more important is probably chopping veggies with a similar texture and cooking time in same-size pieces, so they will cook at the same rate. 

And, sometimes it's easier to do a ton of chopping/prep all at once and keep containers of chopped veggies in the fridge to use through the week, or in the freezer to use over longer periods of time. Some people also like to buy the giant container of pre-chopped garlic at Costco. It is a bit more expensive than buying whole, but many grocery stores now have pre-chopped veggies (and fruit) available, if this is becoming a time-sink that will keep you from making vegetarian meals.

Feeling ""satsified"" by meat is mostly a function of umami flavors.  Umami comes from an inessential amino acid.  So surprise, surprise, it's found in abundance in meat.  It's a major part of why nuts and seeds are satiating but other foods aren't.

If you want to find umami type it into google.  People search for flavors.  A lot of difficulty comes from bad flavor profiles and not actual nutrition.  Umami isn't part of a necessary protein but it accompanies protein.  So, this goes well with this and tastes nutritious.  That's taste that's telling your body what you're missing.

8298,rebble_yell,"I think your are suffering from a form of what the Catholics call [scrupulosity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrupulosity):

&gt;In scrupulosity, a person's obsessions focus on moral or religious fears, such as the fear of being an evil person or the fear of divine retribution for sin. Although it can affect nonreligious people, it is usually related to religious beliefs.

So I think here you may be experiencing a 'moral' form of scrupulosity -- the idea that if you eat an egg you are killing lots of male baby chickens.  

This is compounded by the fact that massive dietary change is usually pretty difficult, since so many of our emotional and physical needs are bound together in food.  

It's important to feel good about what you eat, but it may be helpful to think about a program of eventually being more fully harm-free, but to take it in steps.  

Right now you are harming yourself by torturing yourself over your food, so it may be a good idea to slowly progress over time to a more harm-free diet by going slowly -- removing a few of the worst 'offending' foods over time and slowly adding better options in.  

This gives you time for your digestive system to adapt to the new foods and gives you time to figure out new foods that you like and appreciate.  

So rather than trying to be 'perfect' all at once (and at the same time as dealing with Type 1 diabetes) why not just go slowly?

There's no more point in you feeling guilty for being and alive and eating than there is for a tiger or bear to feel guilty for existing.      Yes you can make wiser and compassionate choices in consuming but isn't it better to make those choices out of wisdom rather than guilt?",1,vegetarian,2019-10-07 21:34:13

8347,mistakescostextra,"But no one in this conversation is saying fish isn’t an animal. 

The only issue at hand is the usage of the word meat. Some people use meat to refer to mammalian sources of animal flesh or non-aquatic sources of animal flesh. This is a more limited definition and can cause confusion. It is rooted in cultural differences and linguistic ambiguity, not in a misunderstanding of commonly accepted biological taxonomy. 

In the same sense that your local supermarket may have a butcher that runs the meat department and a fishmonger that runs the fish counter. Neither the butcher nor the fishmonger disagree that fish are animals, they just define meat to be a specific group of foods and fish to be another group of foods. 

All I’m saying is be aware that this is not an uncommon variant in the usage of the word “meat” so that you can avoid related confusion when ordering at an unfamiliar place.

But I will also have to prove via an independent laboratory analysis that the food is indeed not vegetarian. If you complain to government agencies about a particular restaurant all they usually do is send them a letter of concern which restaurant owners simply throw away. And in worst case scenarios where small restaurants are shut down (which I’ve never heard of relating to this) it’s easy for the owner to lease another spot and open up another restaurant using a different name. This is what car dealerships do when the DMV shuts them down due to patterns of fraud. They open up another dealership under a different business name. Believe it or not my Dad helped shut down 3 car dealerships in 1 city (Glendale,CA) due to fraud from the same owner all in the year 2018.

8390,mistakescostextra,"Let’s be clear, I’m not making the argument. I’m just saying people use the word meat differently. For some people meat is pork, beef, lamb, etc. and fish is it’s own thing. 

For example, Catholics during Lent will abstain from meat but can eat fish. So the idea of one type of animal protein being distinct from others has some basis in cultural practices. 

Obviously these words aren’t super precise. Like you mentioned fruits and vegetables. But not grains/cereals. And are vegetables simply plant foods that aren’t botanical fruits or cereals? And if so where do mushrooms and yeast fit in? And do we use the botanical definition of fruit or the culinary one? 

So ambiguity is sort of inherent to language and it’s not just confusion by non-vegetarians. That’s all I was noting with respect to fish vs. meat.

8472,kizunguzungu,"I understand how you're feeling. Human beings are complicated, messy animals, and I think everyone who tries to live an ethical life will have moments where it hurts to witness all of the cruelty people cause. 

Carrying that hurt with you as anger is cruelty towards yourself, however, and it makes it difficult to treat others with compassion. The trick is to turn this feeling of frustration and despair into an opportunity to grow your ability for empathy--instead of fighting against cruelty and ignorance in the world, focus on spreading kindness. 

People generally have good intentions, but we're often driven by fear and survival instincts that put us at odds with the better parts of ourselves. If we can see this, we can control our actions and live ethical and compassionate lives. But that kind of self-awareness is difficult and takes a long time to cultivate. And no matter how much we grow, we all continue to vulnerable to blind spots and moments of failure. 

People don't want to hurt others. That's why they don't want to watch those videos--it hurts them to see suffering and they don't want to be part of it. But people are conditioned by society from the day they're born, and most modern people have been conditioned to treat meat and animals as two entirely separate things. If they are forced to comfort the fact that the steak on their plate came from a suffering animal, they feel bad and scared and afraid. And when people feel that way,  they tend to either try to ignore what's made them feel that way, or they lash out against it. 

This doesn't make them bad people--it makes them people. But the lesson to learn is that people can't grow when they feel threatened. 

If you learn to accept other humans as flawed but capable of goodness as well as cruelty, you can live a far more peaceful life and inspire others by example. Instead of showing people videos of the cruelty of the slaughterhouse, try inviting them over for a tasty vegetarian dinner. You might not change minds overnight but that's okay.

Fat is one of the most filling nutrients, but it’s one that most people tend to get from meat rather than plants, so new vegetarians can have trouble getting enough.

On the vegan side, go for avocados, nuts, peanut butter, foods made with coconut milk, and vegetable oils (particularly coconut, though olive’s also good). Tahini’s good if you like it too. On the non-vegan side, dairy (particularly cheese) has lots of fat.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-07 15:22:05

8493,scratchythepirate,"To me I think you need to look into how to incorporate complementary proteins into every meal. Plant proteins on their own are incomplete whereas meat proteins are complete. To make sure that you're getting bioavailable protein each plant protein needs to be matched with a counterpart, which will help you stay full longer, get more energy, and be healthier.

Some great examples of complementary proteins are:
- black beans and rice
- lentils and pita (wheat)
- chickpeas and naan (wheat)
- tofu and rice

For every plate you make up try to make it about 50% vegetables, balancing raw and cooked; 25% whole grains; 20% complementary protein rich food; 5% unsaturated fats (like extra virgin olive oil or canola oil)

Hope this helps, you can do this!

8498,Kimosuke,"I made an altered recipe for omurice made in a rice cooker (omurice is flavored rice covered with omelette). 
Chop 1/4 to 1/2 a small onion, and cut up about 4 shiitake mushrooms. Put two cups of rice in a rice cooker and add the usual amount of water for that. Add the onion, the mushroom, two tablespoons of ketchup, some butter (I dunno, a tablespoon?) a little salt and pepper and a tablespoon of powdered bouillon (soup stock stuff) to the rice cooker and press “cook.”
When the rice is cooked, mix immediately and add salt and pepper to taste. Then make an omelette with two eggs mixed with 2 tablespoons milk or soy milk and a little salt and pepper. Put some of the rice in a bowl to give it a shape and then overturn it on a plate. Top with the omelette and then put ketchup and mayo, maybe parsley on top as you like. 
Original recipe from here (Japanese): https://cookpad.com/recipe/5853608

Try asking the question ""Have you ever considered giving up meat?"" I doubt anyone will say ""No"", but maybe. If someone says ""yes""... you've got a conversation and you should listen.

8571,hollowboned,"I’m glad to hear you’re in therapy; I hope it’s helping you! Have you spoken to your therapist about mindful eating? That helped me relearn how to approach food and my therapist walked me through it.

A big thing I’ve noticed is that you’re tracking your food intake and macros. As counterintuitive as it sounds, stop for a while. Eat what you want. Stop when you’re hungry. Nutritionism is more of an art than a science and trying to adhere to a set of global standards probably isn’t helping.

That probably sounds like terrible advice to give someone who binges, but I binge and it’s the only advice that works for me. I don’t beat myself up if I binge, but the question I ask myself before eating is whether I really want it. That triggers me to think about how I’ll feel when I’m finished with it, and whether that feeling is worth it. It’s usually not when I’m staring down my fifth helping.

It sounds like you’re not eating much beyond veggies and tofu, but correct me if I’m wrong. Try incorporating more nuts, beans, and fats. I can’t tell if you’re vegan or vegetarian, but if the latter, have some cheese. If vegan, make a cashew spread with nooch. Try to make foods you enjoy that feel good to eat. Be intuitive, not scientific, for a while. You may find that it will reset your relationship to food and you’ll stop fearing it.

Besides all that, all I can say is that you should feel good about what you eat.",7,vegetarian,2019-10-07 01:50:27

To make milk a cow must be pregnant constantly.  Only instead of the milk going to the calves it is sold to humans. The male cows are often killed very young and sold as veal. Cows that aren’t making milk or contributing profit to the farm are very expensive to feed and take care of, economically it’s a poor decision for a farm to keep them. 


So you can go to the farmers market and chat with the farmers but I’m willing to bet none of them have a farm with lots of roosters and male cows running around living out their lives happily, it’s just a suicidal business move.",2,vegetarian,2019-10-07 00:40:31

8586,litanyofgendlin,"Be okay with being hungry. Not for long and nothing crazy, but when you're a teenager wanting to eat less/no meat with a family thats against it you need to prove to them that you actually are serious about it. Eat the side dishes, pick meat out of dishes when possible, even offer to sometimes help make some easy side dishes. After a little bit they'll realize that you're taking this seriously and usually accommodate you in some manner, by making more side dishes or setting a little bit of the main meal aside before they add meat. 

Usually families like that don't really care about the facts of ""even if you kill them nicely you're still killing an innocent creature"" or ""this is really terrible for the environment"" but if you can show them that this is something that you really care about, its easy enough for them to make an extra large side dish and let you just not eat the meat. Its super easy for them to let you, so really just keeping at it for a bit and showing them this is something that matters to you might be enough to have them chalk it up to ""we don't understand why our kid wants this but its not hurting or inconveniencing me so I guess we'll let her"" (obviously if your parents are abusive or overly controlling this method will not work) but a lot of reasonable parents do accept it.

I went vegetarian when I was 16. My family doesn't hunt or anything but they definitely were ""meat is the center of every single meal how could you eat a meal without meat"" and side dishes were like, some cold mashed potatoes or whatever. They were incredibly unsupportive of it but after seeing that I was sticking to it they gave up and just started making extra side dishes because it was more hassle to yell at me about it then just accept I wasn't going to.",2,vegetarian,2019-10-06 23:51:45

8590,Daniel20190914,"Just say you prefer to be the ""gatherer"" in a hunter-gatherer society and that you don't need meat to survive. They'll understand. On the other hand, people who hunt what they eat are respectable because it's a rare skill nowadays. Try to tone down the moral superiority when you mention vegetarianism. You don't have to get in an argument if you don't want to. You're basically choosing your own lifestyle and if it's not too much trouble for your family, they'll let you.

Why is eating less meat beneficial to all of us? For one thing, maintaining a supply chain of meat requires significant burning of fossil fuel for refrigeration and distribution. Another thing is the cattle themselves emit greenhouse gases, about 20% of all methane released into the atmosphere. In general, the higher up the food chain, the larger the base it requires to support an individual. Eating meat puts a larger demand on the ecosystem than eating plant. Often times, growing fodder for cattle involves heavy use of pesticides, which damages the environment. Finally, eating vegetables comes with health benefit, which, in the long run, translates into less medical cost, and less burden on the already-fragile US health care system.

I am not one to judge a snake owner on this, and I don't like vegetarian ""purity"" contests in general so I don't think a person is any less vegetarian or vegan for owning a pet that eats meat and giving it proper care(if anything, I would judge a person who claims to care about animal welfare and then selfishly subjects a captive animal to an unhealthy and incorrect diet because of their own human morals and philosophy), but there are many reasons that I, personally, no longer own 20 snakes, and witnessing feeder rodent conditions was one of them.

Though it isn't a book on vegetarian, a book on animal ethics called *Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat: Why It's So Hard to Think Straight About Animals* by Hal Herzog(great read for any vegetarian/vegan who keeps pets, or anyone who feels morally conflicted about pets in general) opens by comparing the ethics of snake ownership and cat ownership, and even considers the ethical implications of feeding snakes with cats as opposed to rats.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

I am a vegetarian who is also in pursuit of an environmental science degree, and though I do not currently own any snakes, I previously kept nearly 20 ball pythons, and would love to have just one again someday. A fully grown corn snake is eating probably 12 adult mice per year, keeping in mind that fully-grown snakes do not need to eat as large of meals relative to their body size nor as frequently as younger snakes that are still growing quickly. If you compare that to an average sized cat, which needs about 50 lbs of some form of meat in a year, the difference is enough for me to comfortably stomach, and I own three cats. I would never limit their meat intake for the sake of their health, but I also don't allow them to go outside for the safety of local songbirds and rodents, which an outdoor cat would likely kill just for fun, in addition to the meat it is being fed. Compare even further to a large dog, and a measly 4-foot corn snake doesn't seem that bad, does it? My primary motivation in being vegetarian is minimizing my impact as much as possible where I can(my diet) to make up for places where I cannot(my rampant desire to keep animals as companions), but not everyone shares that point of view, and you might not as well.

If you have ethical concerns over the production of commercial mice, you will likely have to find someone as local as possible who produces rodents in a way you are more comfortable with, but they will likely be more expensive. It will possibly also limit your options on frozen rodents compared to mass-produced commercial rodents, and live feeding is not ideal for the safety of your snake and because it is unkind to the mouse, and killing it humanely yourself before feeding is a very difficult and unpleasant thing to do. Breeding your own mice is much more expensive still, doesn't solve the issue of killing, and is very impractical for a singular snake, even if it allows you to give the mice the best lives possible. You're also likely to get attached.

\---

That said, if you want a vegetarian-friendly pet, I worked in a pet store for several years and I have suggestions! Typically, customers who were looking for a vegetarian pet opted for something like a rabbit, a chinchilla, or a guinea pig, but it seems like you'd prefer a reptile. If you don't mind one with legs, most turtles and tortoises have totally herbivorous diets, and most of my vegetarian customers didn't have the same problem with insects that they had with rodents, so most lizards are on the table as well, like bearded dragons or leopard geckos. However, with any reptile, the environmentally conscious must consider the heating and lighting needs, and the amount of electricity that uses on a daily basis. A fantastic option is the crested gecko, especially if you have problems with bugs. They do best at room temperature(60F-80F), so additional heating is often unnecessary, though you'll probably have to run your air conditioning if temperatures run above 80F as it is much harder to cool an individual tank than to heat one. In regards to their diet, they are primarily frugivorous(which I think is cute in it's own respect) though still require some insects in their diet. However, crested geckos are typically fed a diet of powdered fruit that is mixed with water, and quality brands of gecko food will also include powdered insects in the mix. They get the nutrition they need, you never have to think about a creepy crawly.

8643,evening_person,"There is scientific evidence that suggests over 80% of people who go vegetarian will quit. Not ""after one year, five years, ten years, etc"", they just will, at some point in the future, sooner or later. To rephrase that, it's 5 out of every 6 vegetarians. Of course, the vast majority of self-identified vegetarians and vegans in these studies are not as strict about avoiding meat as you say you've been for years now, and I honestly don't know if that helps or hurts your chances. [Here is a post by a professor of Psychology at Western Carolina University on the topic.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animals-and-us/201412/84-vegetarians-and-vegans-return-meat-why) His book *Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat* was instrumental in my decision to go vegetarian after debating on it for nearly 2 years.  


I have heard the people with the strongest chance of staying vegetarian are those who are truly disgusted by meat, and I know that does not apply to myself. For me, and I perhaps for you too, it is an every day decision to not eat meat. I hope that if you ever decide to return to eating meat, you stick to your decision of only eating fish, and I hope if I ever quit, I make a similar decision. Many people who quit go full-force back into meat eating, and what is far more important than some people being 100% vegetarian is 100% of people eating less meat.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-06 19:43:32

I measured some things but winged a lot of this, so I’ll do my best! 

TOFU MARINADE (measurements are approximate!)

\-1-2 tablespoons natural peanut butter (you could leave this out, but I love the peanuty flavor)

\-¼ cup soy sauce cut with 2-3 tablespoons water

\-¼ teaspoon ground ginger

\-1 tablespoon garlic powder

\-The juice of one lime

\-Red pepper flakes to taste

PAD THAI SAUCE

\-2 tablespoons tamarind paste (I meant to get the unsweetened and unseasoned kind, but I didn’t. Still worked great).

\-1-2 tablespoons natural peanut butter

\-3-4 tablespoons of soy sauce

\-½ a lime, juiced

\-2 -2½ tablespoons brown sugar

\-1-2 tablespoons or more if you like it spicy, Sambal oelek

OTHER STUFF:

\-1 block of tofu, prepared [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/bes3fv/lemon_pepper_crusted_tofu_with_wild_rice_blend/el84ts6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and cut into bite size triangles

\-Vegetables (I used onion, cauliflower, and carrots..

\-2-3 eggs (leave it out if you want it vegan)

\-8 ounces (dry) pad thai noodles

\-crushed peanuts for topping

\-Green onions, chopped, to taste (I used about 4 stalks)

\-Cornstarch for coating the tofu

\-Extra lime wedges for garnish

1. Mix up your marinade and begin marinating your prepared tofu (let it marinade for at least 30 mins, shaking it every now and then)

2. Whisk your sauce ingredients together

3. Lightly coat your tofu in cornstarch and fry in a little oil (I like coconut) 2-3 minutes per side until golden and crispy

4. Cook whatever veg you want over high heat and brown it lightly.

5. Push it to the side and scramble a few eggs. Mix it up into the veg.(You could also leave them out to make it vegan!)

6. Add your cooked pad thai noodles, the sauce, and some chopped green onions. Push it to the side and cook 5-6 cloves of garlic, stir it in.

7. Add more soy sauce if you want

8. Top with crushed peanuts and the tofu

9. Makes 3-4 servings depending on how hungry you are :)",26,vegetarian,2019-10-06 18:33:49

Ingredients:

- 1 head cauliflower 
- 1 onion 
- 1 capsicum 
- 1/3 bag frozen mixed veggies 
- 150g broccoli rice 
- pineapple!!! (Chunks) 

Batter: 

- 2 cups plain all purpose flour 
- 2 cups water
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp chilli powder
- 1tsp salt 
- 1 tsp pepper
- 2 cups panko bread crumbs (can use just baatter but adds a tasty crunch!) 

Sauce:

- 2 tsp minced garlic 
- 1 tsp minced ginger 
- 1 tbsp chilli sauce 
- 1 tbsp sesame/peanut oil 
- 2 tbsp tomato paste 
- 1/2 tsp salt 
- 1/2 tsp pepper 
- 1/3 cup rice wine vinegar 
- 1/2 cup sugar 
- 1/2 cup water 
- 2tbsp corn starch 

Method: 

- mix all the batter ingredients except panko together and whisk until a thick slurry. 

- pour panko crumbs into separate bowl.

- chop cauli into bite size florets.

- dip each floret into batter then roll in panko and set aside. 

- dice onion and slice capsicum in thin but long pieces.

- large frying pan, fry the cauli, you’ll need to in batches, don’t over crowd the pan. It’s pretty great, just let the cauli sit and when the batter has set, it’ll come loose easy so you can flip. When golden, set aside on chopping board. (About 5 mins to cook) 

- when about halfway through the cauli, in another pan, fry up your pineapple, capsicum and onion and when they’re browning add broccoli rice and frozen veggies. 

- once all is cooked, mix all sauce ingredients together (except corn starch) and cook on high heat. As it boils, gradually stir in corn starch. Once thickened, add veggies and cauli - serve!",3,vegetarian,2019-10-06 07:50:31

8795,hollowboned,"Onion is difficult to eat raw as a snack unless you’ve incorporated it into something larger like a salad. It’s very strong and best eaten in small quantities, otherwise it’s overpowering. That said, I can’t judge anyone for eating sautéed onions out of the pan... I do that often enough.

I think radish is a delicious, underappreciated veggie snack. It has a spiciness that’s addictive. Slice them (thick if you want it crunchy, thin if flexible) and chow down. Pretty much any vegetable can be eaten raw if you dip it in something, even ranch dressing.

I have to ask about your pickiness. I thought I hated certain vegetables and it turns out they’d never been cooked properly for me. Green beans don’t have to come from a can! Buy them fresh and they’re crisp and delicious when steamed for about 5 minutes and then pan cooked for a few minutes in butter. Brussel sprouts are incredible when sliced in half and roasted in the oven with balsamic vinegar or butter. Broccoli should never be mushy, cook them similarly to green beans, or eat raw.

Honestly, I recommend going to the grocery and picking up fresh veggies you’ve had before and try cooking them at home. Then branch out to veggies you haven’t tried.

For meals, you can’t go wrong with vegetable stew. Last night I made a huge pot by sautéing onions in seasonings and homemade veggie stock until it had reduced, then adding other root vegetables (radish and potato) and garlic with a little more stock until it reduced again. I deglazed the pan with a little whiskey and added a ton more seasoning and stock, then added in carrots, celery, zucchini, and more onion. After it boiled I mixed in a cornstarch slurry to thicken it, let it get back to boiling, and then reduced the heat and tossed in a cup of frozen peas and a can of corn. You can stop there and have a delicious stew, but I made biscuit dough with herbs and cheese and put it on top, then baked the whole pot for 30 min.",4,vegetarian,2019-10-06 04:48:24

8804,TheEruditeIdiot,"I resent food preparation.  If I’m going to chop vegetables, which I am loath to do, I ‘ll only do it if it doesn’t make sense not to.

For instance, if I’m making an omelette it doesn’t make sense for me to try to engage in a non-kitchen activity.  The omelette will be ready within a minute or two.  So I’ll slice some carrots up or break up some broccoli and rinse it then throw that in.

I’m not wasting any time; I’m getting some nutrients.  Tastes fine.

Putting my cards on the table:  I’ve worked out what works for me.  A few years ago I decided to try to live off less than 50 food sources (so Pace Picante has a bunch if ingredients, but I counted it as 1).  I stuck to it strictly for about 6 months.

I looked at nutritional profiles, what was convenient, etc.

I didn’t get up to the ceiling of 50.  There were a bunch if things I knew I would want (beans (3 different types), eggs, milk, bread, onions, carrots, broccoli, tomatoes, tuna, bananas, etc), there were some things I didn’t expect to want/need that I added in (coconut milk, yogurt, chia seeds, raisins).

I know this is not the sub to talk about eating meat, but I did allow myself to eat meat at most once/2 weeks.  That took up three of my food slots.  Popeyes thighs &amp; drumsticks + tamales from a grocery store.

Just adding that for completion.  Not proud to say it, but I was eating less meat at that

8818,TheEruditeIdiot,"I don’t think that either cooking meat or cooking vegetables is inherently easier.  I found it easier to cook vegetables because I have a wide range of textures, etc., that is palate friendly.

I think it’s pretty easy to go vegetarian if you like beans.  Beans and rice is a thing.  You can put some veggies and spices or sauces into that.  Beans + tortillas is a staple.

I love me some beans.  Black beans, garbanzo beans (aka chickpeas), red beans, refried beans.  They do the trick.  If you buy them canned (which I do because I’m rich) you should rinse them (pour water into the can and drain water out of the can a few times, until it’s mostly clear).  Reduces flatulence.

Eggs go a long way.  They go into tortillas well.  Also pair well with beans.

If you’re okay with nuts, almonds are a nice snack. I guess that isn’t cooking though.

I would say beans, potatoes, bread, vitamin-specific vegetables like carrots (A) and broccoli (K), plus the nice flavorful veggies like onions (Vit C) help found it out.  Rice can be a nice filler.

All you would have to do is put some butter in the pan, place a tortilla shell in the pan, add cheese and then fold the tortilla shell in half so it looks like a half circle.  Then keep your eyes on it, flip it occasionally too. 

For tacos, you could buy Boca or morning star crumbles. Then you need taco seasoning. All you would do is combine that in a pan with some water at medium heat and stir every few minutes.  It'll come together nicely. Then you can buy stuff like lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, salsa, etc and people can put whatever they want on their tacos :)

8859,LordCheezIttt,"It’s actually not easy being vegan. At all. It’s a major lifestyle change. You can’t go to 99% of restaurants, you have to either eat the same bland meals all the time to get protein or else literally become a chef. The entire food industry is based on animal products. I’ve been vegan. I know for a fact it’s not easy. And don’t use animal products as an example because that’s clearly an easy aspect to veganism.

Let’s assume you disagree with me still. That’s fine. But whether you like it or not this is perception of most people - especially those who haven’t even delved into concepts like vegetarianism.

And btw, the hormone thingy related to soy and how it contains estrogen or how it can lower your testosterone levels is a myth. Healthy person can consume as much soy as they like. Plus, soy dairy products are supplemented with vitamins too. 

And restaurants...well I try avoid eating out as much as I can.

8871,ItsJustLittleOldMe,"&gt;Like why do people even eat meat? :D

I know that was likely a rhetorical question, but I think it's worth answering anyway.

I think there are several reasons aside from the obvious ""tradition"" and ""taste preference"".

For instance, some people who still eat meat do it for certain nutrients that they say you don't get from veggies. That's the thing I get concerned about. I can't remember off the top of my head, but there are certain types of amino acids, and omega 3s without 6s, and certain B vitamins that apparently are hard if not impossible to get from plants. 

Then there's soy. Some people are sensitive to soy and that's in a lot of meat ""replacers."" Actually soy is in lots of food in general. Even if you can tolerate it, too much can alter your hormones and people with certain thyroid issues might need to restrict soy products.

Also, it can be tricky eating vegetarian at conventional restaurants. So many things are made with animal products. Vegetables sautéed in lard (looking at you Outback), soups made with chicken broth (diners) or sauces made with beef stock (Asian restaurants).

I searched for 4 days before my birthday in July for a restaurant we'd ALL enjoy and came up empty-handed. My dad is also *very* picky with food. Anything ""different"" is unacceptable - he's an old fashioned meat'n potatoes guy or a hamburger guy. Never deviates from that at restaurants and resists trying anything new because it's ""weird."" Sadly, we've been here 20+ years and it's been the same forever. The restaurant we went to on my sister's birthday had 4 vegetarian options; 2 of which were just tofu appetizers, one was miso soup, and the other was stir fried vegetables.

9095,geeksshallinherit,"Well we do spend a lot, to be honest, but that's about every other week. My SO decided to ditch discounter meat and, it turns out, veg replacements are way more affordable than high quality meat (I mean I knew, but he was blown away).

Replacements are a treat, otherwise we always have fresh, canned and frozen veggies (depends on the season), different dry kinds of beans and lentils, tofu, onions, garlic, ginger, olive oil and a lot of rice. Also, I love my spices and buy them from an Indian store in town, much better quality and flavour.",1,vegetarian,2019-10-05 04:36:27
9096,willdieinsun,"I had this problem for the longest time. I only recently really got turned on to vegetables. 

I’ll say this I totally get it. It doesn’t matter what way it’s prepared even the thought of it makes you wanna gag right? And it’s the worst bc you’re like, “I wanna eat veggies but I literally can’t I’ll gag” and stuff like that, right? 

Here’s what helped me: 

1: don’t think about the dish as it’s parts, think about it as it’s whole (ie not “im having stew and there’s onions in it and I hate onions” just think “I love stew and I’m excited for this stew etc) 

2: keep a positive outlook. This kinda feeds into the last one but don’t think about not liking something think about how excited you are for whatever you’re eating. It’ll feel cheap and weird in your head at first but if you ever find yourself focusing on the negatives just take a deep breath and reorient your thoughts. It’ll start sticking after a while

3: introduce veggies into things you know you love. My hallelujah moment was veggie pizza. I used to be huge into meat lovers and now I get the most excited for veggie pizzas 

4: when you’re trying something new take a big bite and don’t hesitate. This feeds back into thinking of it as a whole and thinking positive. It helps you focus on all the flavors and not just the stuff you don’t like 

5: this one might be a little controversial but honestly it’s what got me to where I am. Go full vegetarian for a while and really put effort into making meals and experimenting with foods with lots of veggies. It’s insane how much my palate changed in like 2 weeks of vegetarianism. I tried slowly introducing veggies into my diet and forcing myself to eat stuff I didn’t like at the time and it just didn’t work at all. A lot of it is just being brave and trying new things and being positive about it

6: if you know someone who’ll eat just about anything and really likes food in general, maybe try eating veggies with them more. My bf is the one who convinced me to go vegetarian and has supported me trying new things and it’s really changed my outlook on veggies  

7: don’t be too hard on yourself if you don’t like EVERY veggie and still struggle with eating vegetables sometimes. I still don’t really like mushrooms or tomatoes and sometimes I still fall back into the habit of avoiding veggies completely and only doing “safe” foods. It’s ok, just keep trying! 

You’ve got this! I know it’s hard, but that fact that you’re trying is what matters! Feel free to dm me if you wanna talk more 😊",1,vegetarian,2019-10-05 04:29:40

My big change was a change in mindset.

I’m still uncomfortable saying it to people I don’t know as well and will edge around the subject as long as possible. One way I’ve found to bring myself out into the open is to offer up some of my snack (I keep a ton of snacks on hand at all times as a general rule, plus there’s a Trader Joe’s right by my office) and when they say something like “oh! I’ve never had these rice crackers before, they’re yummy!” I respond with, “thanks! I love them because the flavor is that nice tamari flavor AND they’re vegan!” Or if we’re eating lunch I’ll mention how good my tofu is today or something along those lines. And then they can just say thanks and walk away/continue another conversation *or* maybe ask me why I said my food is vegan.

&gt; Dr. Laine said if Dr. Johnston had chosen to disclose a financial relationship with the food industry group, it would not have changed the journal&amp;#039;s decision to publish the research.

&gt; Dr. Frank Hu, the chair of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said he was stunned when he realized that Dr. Johnston was both the leader of the meat study and the same researcher who led the industry-funded review that attacked guidelines advising people to eat less sugar.

&gt; Dr. Hu said Dr. Johnston&amp;#039;s methods were not very objective or rigorous and the tool he employed in his meat and sugar studies could be misused to discredit all sorts of well-established public health warnings, like the link between secondhand smoke and heart disease, air pollution and health problems, physical inactivity and chronic disease, and trans fats and heart disease.

For latter, the specific kind of meat is important. Doctors usually tell people to skip red meat, but rarely tell people to skip fish. In fact, some doctors recommend eating fish/poultry as alternative proteins. That's why Pescetarianism is considered a subset of vegetarianism.

Trying the vegetarian diet was (and still is) considered great for your health, and not necessarily connected with a political stance. It was understood that people may ""cheat"" on their diet or only choose to follow certain parts. Thus, a lot of people were educated by dieters, not for-the-animals vegetarians.

* That traditionally brought me comfort, and
* That I can smell right now

Boneless wings from Wingz Over. A perfectly home-grilled cheeseburger\*. The smell of a steak over open fire at the next campsite. A fish fry with the \*right\* batter.

But these are tbh very much the exceptions for me. I've 100% lost the desire to have meat on everything. I don't think twice about a bean &amp; rice burrito (w/ other burrito toppings of course!), or getting General Tsao's Tofu, or getting the falafel wrap instead of the lamb gyro, or having egg salad instead of chicken salad. The biggest challenge has always been the fringe cases, like the soups made with beef base, or the fact that (in the States) bacon is just indiscriminately sprinkled on EVERYTHING even where it clearly doesn't belong.

It would be but the problem with calling yourself a flexitarian when you eat meat/meatproducts maybe once a year is that people will be less willing to accommodate for you. 

They hear flexitarian so they will assume that today can be a meat day.  

I don't eat meat however I do occasionally eat gelatin products and am kinda (albeit grudgingly) oke with animal broth if veggie is not an option, because no one is gonna kill an animal to make broth.

I visualized the whole process in my head... The answer is a resounding no.

I keep all this present in my mind, the horror, the squallor, the suffering, the inhumanity, every time I see meat.
It's a daily choice.
The sterilized and varnished presentation tries to hide all that, confuse me, but I hold on to the truth... And I choose not to be part of this monstrous mass-addiction any more.

It’s just that most people in the US/UK associate “vegetarian” with “ovo-lacto-vegetarian” (egg-milk-vegetarianism). The sub-category of vegetarianism that doesn’t include these things is called “strict vegetarianism” in English. Other synonyms are “100% plant based diet” or even “vegan diet”. I identify myself as a strict vegetarian. No need to apply ethically charged words to diet matters. In Portugal I can just say “vegetarian” and a lot of other vegetarians won’t assume that I eat eggs/milk, but for some reason in the UK/US they do. You can just say that you are a strict-vegetarian and then specify that you don’t eat eggs/dairy/animal products (or that you eat a 100% plant based diet).

9549,SwatchVineyard,"I used to work in that area. In that same area, you should try Bombay Express. They are all vegetarian Indian. Best Samosas in town. Really,  best Indian food for me and I've been to many. This place is one of the few that don't make me sick. I recommend their chole puri or any of their chats.

Mod pizza is also in that area. Oven style personal pizza with fresh ingredients. I think they even have gluten free crusts too. They take a.... healthier approach to pizza.

Best veggie burger is probably Work Horse Bar. They make it in-house. It's about 17 minutes away from Bodhi.

Favorite sunday brunch is Boldin Creek cafe. Just go on the trail for some light exercise then brunch at the cafe. It fits your vegetable purist style, for a lack of better term. So does Mother's cafe and Kerbey Lane. They are all kinda in one group for me.

Also try Sassies Vegetarian food truck about 20 minutes south from bodhi. It is vegan chicken and waffles. Her sides are pretty good too. She makes her ""meat"" replacement herself for the chicken and waffles. I think her replacement is seitan and grains. Awesome experience for us vegs. Even my non-veg friends like it!


There is a vegan grocer called Rabbit Food. It's a pretty small store, but worth the gander because they tend to have a lot of things that franchise grocers dont have.

Nothing can compare to Bodhi. Veggie Heaven (downtown) is massively disappointing in comparison because I never get consistent quality. 

Last is Beer Plant. I really like this place because it's the most date-night place. Great atmosphere and even better food. All of the other places listed are kinda pedestrian like in their ambience.


Plenty of these places listed in this thread can be found in the ATX Vegan network. You can go to their site and take a gander.

Take how many calories are in a single bison, how much water they consume, and how much grassland one bison needs and then compare that to the same amount of calories in staple crops and how much land and water they use and the plants win by a massive margin... always. 

You could make the argument that if you are on land that isn't suitable to cropping and you're only taking wild bison that you are making a more environmentally conscious choice but the number of people that could live that way is phenomenally small. 

Where I live in New Zealand the original inhabitants, the Maori, managed to drive the Moa (a bird larger than an ostrich) to extinction in around 50 years using only hand weapons and with a population of probably a few thousand people spread over an area the size of Italy. 

Even stone age communities with very little technology and small populations can absolutely devastated population numbers.

\- Cooked every day of the week. I used to have take-out or skip dinner if I'm feeling tired, and only cooked 1-3 times a week.

\- Added beans/lentils and leafy greens to every meal. 

\- Drank homemade smoothies and fruit drinks (by pulsing fresh fruit and water together) in place coffee or tea. I would have these with a meal because vitamin C helps with iron absorption.

9637,PixelsAreYourFriends,"Oddly enough, growing up my mom would buy eggs from this little farm that the family down the road from us ran. She didn't kill the animals unless they were sick and would be euthanized. She had this big back yard that her chickens would run around in and they were all super sweet. Nicest old lady ever.

Anywho, it just made me only really feel dirty about buying eggs if it was from a store. If you're in an area where there are folks with livestalk, look into it. Lots of times they just sell the eggs because they just like having chickens but can't just have a billion eggs lying around.

I'm also reading that you have an iron deficiency.

2) it is difficult to call wild bison slaves. Bison can run 40 mph. They can jump 6 ft high standing still snd far higher running. The fences I build are 5-6' tops. Mostly barbed wire, which bison cannot feel, as they have 7 times more hair per square inch than cattle. Yesterday, I watched a yearling calf casually crawl through five lines of fencing because it felt like it. Today, I watched a cow casually snap brand new stainless steel chains (which were used to secure a gate) because she wanted to. The gates are there so the bison don't overgraze (as it is a holistically managed ranch, so soil matters too). The bison are not domesticated. Every day is a day I should be dead when I am among the herd. At a certain point, you gotta wonder why the bison choose to stay on the ranch when they can clearly leave whenever they want.

9661,lastpeaceofpie,"I am currently getting my bachelors in microbiology, so I’ve actually learned a bit about this. There’s lots of bacteria in your gut, they actually do a lot of digestion for us. They eat some, break it down, and then we digest some and absorb all the stuff we need. There’s lots of different bacterial families and they all have different preferences as to what compounds they digest. When you maintain a certain diet for a while, the bacterial families that are better at breaking down those compounds are most abundant. If you were to suddenly mix up your diet, the bacterial family that digests that new food is not abundant enough the digest it quickly. 

Fear not, this doesn’t have any adverse health effects. You might just experience short term gas, bloating, and discomfort. Some people might have weird poops.

Protein is actually one of the easiest nutrients to find. All plants are made up of amino acids (protein).

Different types of plants have varying levels of each amino acid, but as long as you are eating enough calories of varied plant foods (veggies, beans, grains, seeds), you are by default getting enough of each amino acid, no animal body parts or secretions required.

As far as the dishes you mentioned, I like to make sandwiches with lots of fresh veggies like cucumbers, sprouts, and tomato, and add avocado and salt and pepper. I like to make black bean tacos with avocado and salsa, and pasta with tomato sauce and beans and veggies mixed in.

I ate a hamburger as a teenager after being vegetarian for a few years and had stomach cramps for days and I didn’t make the connection until after the fact so I don’t think it was mental but could have been coincidental. Recently I ate half of a veggie burrito before realizing it had a good amount of ground beef in it and while disgusted, I didn’t have GI issues (it’s probably been 15 years since I’ve intentionally consumed beef).

9794,fr0bos,"The fat content could totally be a factor too. Meat has a different composition than plant material (think proteins and amino acids), and when your diet consistently has meat, then the population of bacteria that digest those amino acids grows, but the opposite is true, too. There really is an ecosystem of bacteria where some do an initial breakdown (acidification) and then others eat what the first ones poop out and break it down further, and some are better at digesting meat while others stew better at digesting plant material. They're constantly equilibrating based on the incoming blend of nutrients, so a long term shift in those incoming nutrients shifts the mixture towards plant processors and you can be left with an excess of meat molecules that can't be digested and maybe upset the other bacteria.

9802,eeyorelife,"A transition should not happen instantly or over night. So while you live with your parents (I assume) you can slowly start changing your diet even though it is not possible for you to become a full vegetarian right now.

Start by reading about vegetarianism. Read about nutrients you will be missing from meat and how you can work around that. And read about the reasons for becoming vegetarian. The most compelling arguments are the way animals, especially chickens are being treated, and the environment. 

Start making your own food. Start with choosing vegetarian alternatives when making a sandwich for example. Simple stuff. Make a salad and find out what makes a good salad. Start experimenting in the kitchen. Try making a non-vegetarian meal into a vegetarian meal.

Try to persuade tour parents to taste vegetarian food. Try to get them to make vegetarian food once. You suggest a specific meal you would like for the family to try. Make it an experience for everyone. Maybe it tastes horrible, that doesn't mean it's a failure. Maybe you will eventually get your parents to eat vegetarian once a week? That's a good start!

And lastly, but most importantly: if you are trying to do something, then you are doing infinately more than most people.

9815,fr0bos,"I'll start with a disclaimer that this comes from my experience working with a large anaerobic digester for processing waste food and only a layman's understanding of the actual human digestive system. I think there can be a real reaction because bacterial colonies (including your gut bacteria) get acclimated to their typical ""diet"" over time, and aren't adept at processing a rapid change in the nutritional mix coming in. For instance, at my former plant, for logistical reasons, we were processing only plant-based food waste and a small amount of dairy at first, but then started receiving waste meat. We had to gradually introduce the meat into the process over a couple months to keep the digester bacteria healthy (the increased meat caused changes in pH that we had to keep in check). Eventually the bacteria acclimated and were able to self-regulate without intervention.

TL;DR: gut bacteria acclimate to your typical diet and meat is different enough to upset them if they're not acclimated to it",1,vegetarian,2019-10-03 20:20:05

9891,gwyn_sully,"I tend to make big batches of soups or chilis and then freeze them in single servings so I can just pull one out and reheat it.  If I do need a single serving of soup and I haven't any in the freezer my general formula is to sauté whatever vegetable I have in a generous amount of butter until soft, or a can of beans in olive oil if I am in a veg free state, add just enough broth to make it blend nicely, a splash of cream if I have it, and then add salt and lemon until it tastes bright, and possibly a few drops of hot sauce if it's beans.  This is delicious with a side salad, toast or garlic bread, or even a sandwich or wrap.

Seconding what several people have mentioned about eggs or breakfast foods being a good choice for single servings.  Scrambled eggs loaded with veggies and toast is one of my go-tos.

Quesadillas or pressed sandwiches like paninis are also delicious and an easy thing to stick whatever veggies I happen to have in (are you sensing a theme here?).  In all of these cases the key is to pre-cook your veggies so they don't end up raw in the middle of your sandwich/eggs/whatever.  Usually just a quick sauté is what I go with, unless I've roasted a big batch of vegetables earlier in the week.

From what you've said about the recipe your mushroom and egg noodle dish would work just as well with other vegetables like cauliflower, squash, tomatoes, onions, or even beans.  If you wanted to switch it up leave out the egg noodles and put it over some kind of potato.  Baked, mashed, or fries are all tasty options, and that could coordinate and overlap with whatever your husband is cooking.  Polenta is another good choice.

I also suggest learning to make your own veggie burgers!  [This one](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-grillable-veggie-burgers/) and [this one](https://minimalistbaker.com/smoky-black-bean-beet-burgers/) are two of my personal favorites, but there's a million recipes out there so I'm sure you can find one that is to your taste.  Making a batch can feel like a bit of a commitment, but once they're done I just stick the rest in the freezer to pull out the next time the craving hits.

Stuffed squash is, by nature, fairly single serving as long as you choose a squash of the appropriate size.  I won't even bother to suggest any particular ones because there's so very many, and they range from lasagna stuffed to enchilada stuffed to wild rice stuffed.  When looking for things to stuff the squash with, it's a good idea to try to coordinate with dinners elsetime in the week so you don't have to seek out anything special for a single serve meal.  For instance, if there's a meal earlier that calls for rice or quinoa, make more than is needed so you can use it to stuff your squash with later.

Turns out some things aren't easy. The culture of meat eating is pretty strong. Potatoes and rice are my staples now, with some veggies, oil and spice. My taste buds have changed over time. If I can make the shift, you can too! 

When I learned in nutritional science class that I didn't have to eat meat, it was a revelation. 

Since then I could even imagine giving up cheese, after thinking it unimaginable for several decades. And then they started making plant based cheeses! Sure, the substitutes don't taste exactly the same, and for a time I resisted. Now I don't need the substitutes. I could eat rice, beans and vegetables every meal or potatoes with stuff. It's such a cliche, but I really like tofu now. Before it was tasteless, but over the years I've learned to really like it and cook with it. I'm not as good as my wife. It helps to have a partner who's a really good cook. That's what really tipped me over the edge. And I am so grateful.

Slices: Chao Creamy Original, Violife Cheddar or Provolone, Follow Your Heart Smoked Gouda (or really any flavor they make)

Shreds: Daiya *Cutting Board* Shreds (not the original kind), Violife Shreds (Cheddar is delicious and creamy, melts so nicely for nachos or similar), So Delicious Cheddar Jack (also creamy, melts well, would be great for tacos)

Block Cheese: Daiya makes blocks of cheese as well that are really good with crackers, they taste fairly close to the real deal!  Not sure how well this kind would melt because I've never tried.

Like another comment mentioned, nutritional yeast works really well for a ""cheesy"" flavoring on things.  I'll sprinkle a little in my lunches or on toast or use it to flavor popcorn!

If you love pizza, both Daiya cutting board shreds and Violife have a mozzarella that work really well for pizza!  Daiya also makes some pre-made frozen pizzas that are pretty good if you need a quick fix.  I'm sure you could make your own mozzarella sticks using Violife mozzarella (or similar) that would satisfy that particular craving.
